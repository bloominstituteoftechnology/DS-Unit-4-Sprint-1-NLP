    "After a week of Natural Language Processing, you've learned some cool new stuff: how to process text, how turn text into vectors, and how to model topics from documents. Apply your newly acquired skills to one of the most famous NLP datasets out there: [Yelp](https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge). As part of the job selection process, some of my friends have been asked to create analysis of this dataset, so I want to empower you to have a head start.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The real dataset is massive (almost 8 gigs uncompressed). I've sampled the data for you to something more managable for the Sprint Challenge. You can analyze the full dataset as a stretch goal or after the sprint challenge. As you work on the challenge, I suggest adding notes about your findings and things you want to analyze in the future.\n",

Maybe because I actually looked pregnant this time (I'm currently in my first trimester)? The layout of the store was also better- there was more space, it didn't feel so cramped. I liked looking at all the sales racks in the back, because there was just more to look at! I saw pants, swimsuits, dresses, sweaters, and tank tops, in my sizes, S and XS. Like the other store, the full priced items were in front, while the clearance racks were in the back of the store. The fitting rooms were in the middle of the store. We also looked at the Boppy products (pillows for comfort). We bought a cocoa butter variety pack (located near the cash register/right side of the store, against the wall), and the saleswoman gave us directions on how to use the products. She also gave us coupons, and got my information so I could get more promotions especially for moms. It does make a difference when the sales people show a genuine interest in their customers. \n",
