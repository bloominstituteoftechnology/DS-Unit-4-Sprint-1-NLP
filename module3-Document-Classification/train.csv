1,John Hansell,"A marriage of 13 and 18 year old bourbons. A mature yet very elegant whiskey, with a silky texture and so easy to embrace with a splash of water. Balanced notes of honeyed vanilla, soft caramel, a basket of complex orchard fruit, blackberry, papaya, and a dusting of cocoa and nutmeg; smooth finish. Sophisticated, stylish, with well-defined flavors. A classic!",85.0,97,51.5,2.0
2,Dave Broom,"There have been some legendary Bowmores from the mid-60s and this is every bit their equal. All of them share a remarkable aroma of tropical fruit, which here moves into hallucinatory intensity: guava, mango, peach, pineapple, grapefruit. There’s a very light touch of peat smoke, more a memory of Islay than the reality. Concentrated; even at low strength the palate is silky, heady, and haunting, and lasts forever in the dry glass. A legend is born. (Eight bottles only for the U.S.) Editor's Choice.",13500.0,97,42.9,1.0
3,John Hansell,"This bottling celebrates master distiller Parker Beam's 50 years of service by including whiskey from each of the past five decades. This is a fabulous whiskey: seamless and incredibly complex, with an impeccable marriage of youth and maturity. It’s also very even-keeled throughout -- quite different than last year’s equally impressive PHC, a 27 year old, whose personality was more like an exhilarating old wooden rollercoaster ride (and also brandished more oak). Look for candied citrus, nectarine, blueberry, and sultana anchored by a nougat center, laced with honeyed vanilla and orange creamsicle. There’s a dusting of cocoa powder, brittle mint, and cinnamon, too. Tobacco leaves, polished leather, and teasing bourbon barrel char round out the palate, emerging more prominently towards a warming finish. A classic!",150.0,97,50.0,2.0
4,John Hansell,"What impresses me most is how this whisky evolves; it's incredibly complex. On the nose and palate, this is a thick, viscous, whisky with notes of sticky toffee, earthy oak, fig cake, roasted nuts, fallen fruit, pancake batter, black cherry, ripe peach, dark chocolate-covered espresso bean, polished leather, tobacco, a hint of wild game, and lingering, leafy damp kiln smoke. Flavors continue on the palate long after swallowing. This is what we all hope for (and dream of) in an older whisky!",4500.0,97,40.5,1.0
6,Davin de Kergommeaux,"After 40 years in barrels, the trademark Canadian Club dark fruit is as rich as ever. Reminiscent of raisin tarts with sprinkles of sweet baking spices, then strawberries and black pepper. Warming but never hot. No tannins, no woodiness; silky barrel tones are the only hint of oak, while soaring floral esters speak loudly of time in the barrel. The glowing, never-ending finish is spectacular. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$250",199.0,96,45.0,
9,Fred Minnick,"A caramel-laden fruit bouquet, followed by unending vanilla, leather, tobacco, cotton candy, marshmallow, quince, cinnamon, hints of juniper, and wildflowers. Then, brown sugar butter and maple syrup over buttermilk pancakes, Cracker Jack, raw honey, bittersweet chocolate, and hints of pecan shell. Extremely long finish with a fried apple pie note. An incredibly complex and intense, must-have sipper. Perfection.",150.0,96,54.49,2.0
12,John Hansell,"Distilled at the now legendary Stitzel-Weller distillery. Rich aromas of vanilla toffee, marzipan, cocoa, nutmeg and cinnamon. Similar follow-through on the palate, with black raspberry, maple syrup, teaberry, and dusty dried corn thrown into the mix. Warming cinnamon and polished oak on the finish. The sweet notes balance and integrate nicely with the oak. An exemplary rendition of an ultra-aged wheated bourbon. Price is per 375 ml. Editor's Choice.",300.0,96,45.0,2.0
14,John Hansell,"No age statement, but distilled in 1998. A beautiful expression of Stagg, and a lot of bourbon for your buck. Easy to drink with the addition of water, showing caramel, nougat, dates, dark chocolate, polished oak, along with a hint of leather and tobacco. Slightly better than last year’s release—richer, thicker, and more balanced. I’m enjoying Stagg’s more rounded, less aggressive demeanor of late. A classic! Editor's Choice.",80.0,96,69.05,2.0
15,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Monarch, the 75th anniversary limited edition of Canada’s best-selling whisky, raises the already high Crown Royal flavor bar. Zesty rye from an ancient Coffey still is the throbbing heart of this blend, balancing cloves, ginger, cinnamon, glowing hot pepper, and that gorgeous sour bitterness of rye grain against crispy, fresh-sawn lumber, fragrant lilacs, dark fruits, and green apples. Butterscotch, chocolate, toffee, mint, pine needles, and sweet pitchy balsam enrich a luscious, creamy mouthfeel carefully tempered by grapefruit pith. Editor's Choice",75.0,96,40.0,4.0
16,Dave Broom,"A rich amber color and elegantly oxidized notes greet you. There are luscious old fruits—pineapple, dried peach, apricot—and puffs of coal-like smokiness. In time, sweet spices (cumin especially) emerge. Superbly balanced. The palate, while fragile, still has real sweetness alongside a lick of treacle. It can take a drop of water, allowing richer, darker fruits to emerge. The finish is powerful, long, and resonant. Superb, not over-wooded, and a fair price for such a rarity. £1,995",3360.0,96,47.2,
17,John Hansell,"The complete package: uncut, unfiltered, full-flavored, richly textured (almost chewy), and very complex. Notes of toffee-coated nuts, vanilla fudge, polished leather, cedar-tinged tobacco, barrel char, cocoa powder, and a hint of fig, wrapped up with a firm oak grip on the finish. Worth every penny of the premium price being charged for this commemorative release. Editor's Choice.",100.0,96,65.4,2.0
21,John Hansell,"A marriage of four different bourbons, ranging from 11 to 17 years old. This, to me, is benchmark Four Roses: subtly complex, vibrant, yet fully matured, with well-defined flavors of bramble, dry citrus, soft creamy vanilla, caramel, marzipan, allspice, a hint of cinnamon, and subtle cedar-aged cigar tobacco.  Soft, clean, polished oak finish. A very versatile bourbon! Your decision shouldn’t be whether to buy it, but rather how much water to add.",90.0,96,55.7,2.0
22,John Hansell,"Another excellent Stagg, and considering its alcohol level, it’s also a good value if you can get it at this price. Notes of toffee, pot still rum, nougat, dates, tobacco, roasted nuts, polished oak, and leather. Great depth and nicely balanced. A masculine bourbon of character and structure.",70.0,96,71.4,2.0
23,John Hansell,"Sometime recently, the source of this whiskey changed from the now defunct Stitzel-Weller distillery to Buffalo Trace. No matter. This whiskey is still the best of the Van Winkle line. It’s crisp, clean, vibrant, impeccably balanced, and nicely matured. Complex fruit (bramble, candied citrus), caramel, coconut custard, maple syrup, fresh spice (vanilla, warming cinnamon, nutmeg, a dusting of cocoa powder) on a bed of nougat. Outstanding! (Editor's Choice)",75.0,96,53.5,2.0
25,John Hansell,"From one barrel, and only sold in one location, but well worth the effort to procure a bottle. Nutty toffee, pecan pie, apricot, berried jam, and nougat, peppered with cinnamon, mint, cocoa, and tobacco. Warming, with polished leather and dried spice on the finish.  Seamless, richly textured, and impeccably balanced. (Exclusive to the Bourbon Heritage Center at the Heaven Hill distillery in Bardstown, KY.)",150.0,96,45.0,2.0
27,John Hansell,"Definitely showing its age, but not in a bad way — the distillery character is still there. Solid foundation of thick, chewy toffee, old pot still rum, and fig cake. Fruity too, with notes of golden raisin and nectarine. Soft, seductive peat smoke, juicy oak, cinnamon, and brine round out the palate. Excellent balance! One of the finest Bowmore whiskies I’ve ever tasted (and, at this price, will probably never taste again.) (Editor's Pick)",11000.0,96,44.8,1.0
28,John Hansell,"Unlike the standard “small batch” releases, this is from a single barrel: a really good single barrel. I rated the 18 year old small batch a 93 in the last issue, and I like this one even better. There’s less wood getting in the way. It’s softer, more elegant. Lovely fruit, gently sweet (black raspberry jam, blueberry pie), with nougat, creamy vanilla, a sprinkling of cinnamon, and polished leather on the finish. And so drinkable. Classic stuff!",110.0,96,47.0,2.0
29,John Hansell,"Very similar to last year’s release. (A good thing, since it was wonderful!) Very smooth, with layered sweetness (toffee, fig cake, nougat, maple syrup), dark fruit (black raspberry, blueberry), cinnamon, and polished oak on the finish. A whisky of elegance and sophistication. (Editor's Choice)",70.0,96,63.3,2.0
30,John Hansell,"Perhaps the finest Canadian whisky I have ever tasted. Creamy and seamless from beginning to end. Gently sweet, with orange creamsicle, marzipan, sultana, praline, maple syrup, and a hint of coconut macaroon. Forty Creek whiskies have always been very good, but none have ever had the right stuff to reach classic status. Until now, that is. An outstanding, very distinctive whisky!",70.0,96,40.0,4.0
33,John Hansell,"This whiskey has improved greatly over the past two years. (I thought that the 2007 release was almost too easy-going, as some wheated bourbons can be.) A little more oak spice has added balance, complexity, and depth. Very clean on the palate. Layered sweetness (toffee, caramel, maples syrup, elegant rum) provide a foundation for warming cinnamon, bramble, blueberry tart, sultana, light candy corn, herbal tea, and subtle marzipan. A soft, dry, polished oak finish ropes in all the sweetness, keeping me wanting more. Excellent!",65.0,96,67.4,2.0
34,John Hansell,"Very well-balanced and mellow on the nose and palate.  Sweet notes of mature dark rum, toffee, nougat, and candy corn dovetail with dried apricot, golden raisin, hot cinnamon, soft mint tea, and vanilla.  Polished leather and tobacco leaves on a long, contemplative finish.  This is what ultra-mature bourbon should taste like: all the depth and complexity that comes with this much aging, without all the excessive oak.  The wood is there, but it never crosses the line.  The next closest Heaven Hill bourbon in age is the Evan Williams 23 year old for the export market.  There's no comparison.  The Evan Williams 23 year old is way past its prime.  This Parker's Heritage Collection has it easily beat.  In fact, this Parker's shows less oak and lethargy on the finish than the 129.6 proof expression of last year's inaugural 1996 vintage Parker's Heritage Collection, a whisky less than half its age.  (There were three different expressions, and I thought the other two were outstanding).
Parker Beam chose these whiskeys from the third floor of Warehouse U.  Given that the whiskeys were low in the warehouse, the average summer high temperatures were 6-10 degrees cooler than the top floor; helping to slow the aging process and the oak influence.",200.0,96,48.0,2.0
35,John Hansell,"It’s great that Glenlivet releases whiskies under the 'Cellar Collection' label. It really shows the true potential of Glenlivet. This bottling is classic ultra-matured Glenlivet, and rivals the 1959 vintage Cellar Collection as the best one ever. An incredibly complex whisky, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, coconut, and caramel. All this is accentuated by glazed orange, hazelnut, and a potpourri of dried spices. Not the least bit tired for such an aged whisky. (Only 800 bottles for the U.S.)",750.0,96,50.8,1.0
36,John Hansell,"Powerful, muscular, well-textured, and invigorating. Even within the realm of Ardbeg, this one stands out. The more aggressive notes of coal tar, damp kiln, anise, and smoked seaweed are supported by an array of fruit (black raspberry, black cherry, plum), dark chocolate, espresso, molasses, bacon fat, kalamata olive, and warming cinnamon on the finish. Quite stunning!",85.0,96,57.1,1.0
37,John Hansell,"The Dalmore is one of a handful of whiskies that seem to be able to age in the cask for many decades and still improve. This one is incredibly viscous on the nose and palate (and very heavy on the tongue), with chewy toffee and old pot still rum. The classic Dalmore marmalade note shines throughout, along with vanilla cream, an array of dried spices (especially cinnamon and evergreen), juicy oak, forest bedding, rancio, old armagnac, polished leather, tobacco, maple syrup, dark chocolate, almond macaroon, and subtle espresso. Long, mouth-coating finish. The flavors evolve like waves lapping on the palate -- especially the interplay with the oak. I can’t drink this whisky slowly enough. A rare experience for the lucky few who can afford it. (Price is per 100ml.)",,96,52.8,1.0
38,John Hansell,"A crisp, robust, very dynamic bourbon. Amber-orange marmalade color. Spicy, with notes of cinnamon, spearmint, and Earl Grey tea. The spice is balanced nicely by thick toffee, rhum agricole, caramel apple, and bright citrus, with a polished leather finish. There have been some great Birthday Bourbons, but I think this is the best one to date. A whiskey deserving classic status.",40.0,96,47.0,2.0
39,John Hansell,"Classic sherry cask-aged Macallan. Antique amber with hints of ruby. Thickly textured, complex, and quite deep, with notes of toffee, ripe pit fruit, raisin, apple pie, dried spice (cinnamon, clove, ginger, and mint), and a wisp of smoke. An exceptional, multi-faceted Macallan!",,96,45.4,
41,John Hansell,"My review of this whiskey a few years back indicated that it was too woody and past its prime to be a great whiskey. This one is better. (Yes, bottlings do change.) There’s more balance, and the oak is in check. It’s still big and brooding, with notes of toffee, roasted nuts, dried spice (cinnamon, rosemary, evergreen needles), candied fruit, cocoa, and polished oak. Tobacco and toffee on the finish, with lingering dried spices, and there’s a nice foundation of sweetness to balance all the oak and spice.",220.0,96,47.8,2.0
43,John Hansell,"A wheated bourbon from the old Stitzel-Weller distillery. A gentle, richly-textured whiskey, loaded with fruit and spice. Black raspberry jam, caramel apple, and papaya, along with warming cinnamon and subtle teaberry, on nutty toffee, nougat, and creamy vanilla. Spicy, polished oak finish. Superbly balanced, sophisticated, and very drinkable. An outstanding whiskey!",90.0,96,47.0,2.0
44,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. Surprisingly lively on the nose for its age. A complex array of fruit (tangerine, sultana, pink grapefruit, papaya, and the general overall citrus DNA that you’ll find in old Bowmores), with balancing notes of honey and vanilla. A hint of damp smoke and coconut. Just like with Black Bowmore, this is a texturally soothing whisky on the palate, which continues to evolve in waves -- first the sweet honey, coating vanilla, and lively fruit, then turning quite visceral, with juicy oak, damp earth, deep peat smoke, and charcoal, followed by another wave of fruit (this time, dried fruit), finishing off with subtle charred oak and roasted nuts. This whisky is better than White Bowmore, and it falls just short of Black Bowmore (which I rated 97), because it’s just a bit softer and less vibrant on the palate.",6250.0,96,42.4,1.0
49,Gavin Smith,"This expression was matured in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. Overtly sherried, with figs, sultanas, cinnamon, and old warm leather on the nose. Finally, fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. The Turkish delight carries over to the palate, before the chocolate darkens to plain, with raisins, smoked ham, and cloves in the long finish. Remarkably, almost no tannic oak. Textbook stuff.",,95,46.6,1.0
50,Fred Minnick,"This is a work of art. It begins by revealing vanilla, from custard to cake icing. Then it speaks caramel with a dark chew, crème brûlée, and Werther’s Original hard candy. From here, complexity takes over, with candied popcorn, butterscotch, chocolate ganache, French toast, maple, honey, pumpkin pie, fried pie dough, blueberries, and cinnamon, with hints of molasses and pecan. The long finish seems to offer a concentration of all the flavors. Delicious. Editor's Choice.",90.0,95,64.1,2.0
51,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Oh, the glory of used cooperage. Woody notes begone—let time slowly breathe life into what began as almost neutral, high-proof corn spirit. Creamy spice, barley sugars, peach syrup, dry grasses, and ancient barn boards. Incredible complexity, yet so tightly interwoven it achieves oneness. One hundred points until a campfire bursts onto the finish and consumes five of them.",165.0,95,50.0,4.0
53,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This 100% rye-grain whisky is distilled in Alberta, then shipped to Sonoma, California for final touches. Finished in new American oak, batch PSA3 is one of the tastiest U.S. bottlings of Canadian rye ever. Soft caramels cushion ethereal honeysuckle, blackened firewood, and lusty rye spices on a framework of pulling oak tannins. Hugely complex, with new rewards in every sip.",89.0,95,45.0,4.0
56,John Hansell,"Seamless in flavor and very elegant. A fully matured bourbon (consisting of whiskeys from 11 to 16 years in age), yet quite fresh on the palate. Lively fruit (apricot, red raspberry, tangerine) on a bed of lush sweet notes (caramel, honey-coconut crème brûlée and cotton candy), peppered with cinnamon, clove, and crisp mint. Soft finish, with lingering creamy vanilla. Not as great as the legendary 2013 release, but close.",120.0,95,54.3,2.0
58,John Hansell,"A benchmark aged rye whiskey, and it’s similar in profile to recent releases . Vibrant for its age. Complex too, brimming with allspice, clove, mint, and cinnamon. The spice notes are balanced by soft vanilla, soothing caramel, and candied summer fruits. Impeccably balanced, and a pure joy to drink!",80.0,95,45.0,2.0
59,John Hansell,"Aged 11 years, this year’s single barrel release is a lively mix of caramel and bright, zingy orange on palate entry. Cinnamon, vanilla, and mint emerge mid-palate, leading to polished oak, baked apple, and a hint of leather on the finish. A lively bourbon, with crisp, clean flavors and nicely balanced. Another winner from Four Roses.",100.0,95,60.0,2.0
62,Gavin Smith,"Maturation of this 1978 distillate has taken place in European oak and refill American oak casks. Fresh and fruity on the early, herbal nose; a hint of wax, plus brine, developing walnut fudge, and an underlying wisp of smoke. Finally, wood resin. The palate is very fruity, with mixed spices, then plain chocolate, damp undergrowth, gentle peat smoke, and finally coal. Mildly medicinal. Ashy peat and aniseed linger in the long, slowly drying finish. Brora at its very best. (2,944 bottles) Editor's Choice",750.0,95,49.9,1.0
63,Dave Broom,"The whisky is sensational, a glorious mix of ginseng syrup, baked banana, semi-dried tropical fruits, and an exotic smoked edge. Without the last, you could believe it was a delicate Cognac. In time, there’s peppermint and guava syrup. A sip is all you need to reveal perfect, thrilling harmony: light nuttiness, pollen, subtle fruits, gentle smoke, and light fungal touches. It’s stunning, but it’s £16,000! Whisky this great, even in limited quantities, should be fairly priced. Points off. £16,000",26650.0,95,40.7,1.0
64,John Hansell,"Still lively for 18 years old, with no hint of interfering oak. The age has softened the rye spice, making it an easy entry into the premium rye category. The balance here is beautiful, with rounded spice (mint, cinnamon, licorice root) on a bed of soft vanilla and caramel. Gently, dry finish. Very sophisticated for a rye. It remains my benchmark for extra-matured rye whiskeys, which are becoming exceedingly scarce. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release.",70.0,95,45.0,2.0
65,John Hansell,"The traditionally gentle demeanor of this wheated bourbon is jazzed up with some lovely complex spice (mostly coming from the oak). Sweet notes of maple syrup, silky caramel, blackberry jam, and blueberry are peppered with notes of allspice spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Soft leather on the finish. Great balance. A lovely whiskey! Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release.",70.0,95,68.1,2.0
66,John Hansell,"Less alcohol than past Staggs, even at 128.2° proof. This whiskey has always been one of the best in the portfolio, and its reputation is intact. Sweeter and fuller in body than recent releases, and not as masculine, making it easier to drink. (Don’t worry; it’s still a big Stagg, but with a smaller “rack.”) Vanilla taffy, nougat, dates, polished oak, roasted nuts, leather, and tobacco: it’s all there. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013.",70.0,95,64.1,2.0
68,John Hansell,"The key to bourbons that use wheat instead of rye (like this Weller), is to get the right amount of wood influence to balance the sweet notes and add depth. This whiskey does a great job of it. Notes of dark fruit (blackberry, plum, blueberry), layered sweetness (maple syrup, toffee, caramel), and dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla). Soft, pleasant finish.",70.0,95,61.7,2.0
69,John Hansell,"At this strength, it’s almost like getting two whiskeys for the price of one. A great value, considering its age. (It’s not identified on the label, but was distilled in 1993.) Try to find a great 18 year old, cask-strength single malt scotch for this price. Very mature — with a good dose of oak — but not excessively so. Notes of toffee, tobacco, dark molasses, roasted nuts, dried vanilla, leather, and a hint of dusty corn. Dry on the finish, with lingering leather and tobacco.",70.0,95,71.3,2.0
70,John Hansell,"No age statement, but distilled in 1998. The only wheated recipe bourbon in the 2011 Antique Collection, and a very good one at that. Higher in strength than last year’s offering (which was 63.3%), but very similar (and equally as impressive). The most elegant and smoothest of this collection, with layered sweetness (honey, caramel, marzipan, maple syrup), fig, blackberry preserve, hint of green tea, and just the right amount of spice for balance (nutmeg, cinnamon, cocoa).",70.0,95,66.75,
72,Dave Broom,"Though Brora has acquired cult status, it has to be said that for a few years these Special Release Broras went through an off-putting butyric phase, which might well have put off newbies to this legendary closed site, who must have wondered what all the fuss was about.
One nose of the 2010 SR shows that these days have been consigned to the past. This is classy from the word go. Gold in color; the nose manages to be both overtly waxy — I’m reminded of waxed paper — and fragrant. Behind that is coal smoke, rather than the heavy peatiness of earlier vintages (Brora’s peating levels varied in its last years). In other words, this is robust and powerful, with an evocative aroma that speaks of old sea chests, the seashore, and vellum. Hugely concentrated, with massed fruits — quince especially — following behind. This is amplified with a drop or two of water. 
The palate is unctuous and heavy. Tectonic plates move more quickly than this does in the mouth. When it does, the oily/waxy textures and flavors move slowly — camphor, peach, membrillo, hints of citrus, and toward the finish a growing brininess (akin to olives) and a hint of smoke. Elemental and one of the best Broras for years. [not available in the U.S.]£280",455.0,95,54.3,1.0
73,John Hansell,"An excellent example of an ultra-mature, sherried whisky done the right way. Much darker and more decadent than the other two releases here. Silky texture. Rummy, jammy fruit, toasted walnut, leather, spice (cinnamon, clove), tobacco, and dark chocolate, with a foundation of juicy oak. Tasting this whisky, you know it’s old, but you also know it’s very good.",2525.0,95,44.6,1.0
74,John Hansell,"Surprisingly light and fresh for a 15 year old whiskey. Crisply spiced, with cinnamon, evergreen, vanilla, anise, and teaberry. Hints of dried fruit, kissed with light honey and a wisp of smoke. Balanced and clean throughout, and very drinkable. An excellent whiskey! Price is per 375ml.",47.0,95,45.0,2.0
76,John Hansell,"Glenfarclas has a proven track record for aging very well. I’ve enjoyed some amazing 25 and 30 year old expressions, in addition to some older vintage offerings. Does this new 40 year old follow suit? Absolutely! It’s complex and well-rounded, with great depth and no excessive oak. Lush, candied citrus (especially orange), old pot still rum, maple syrup, fig, roasted nuts, and polished leather, with hints of mocha, candied ginger, and tobacco. A bit oily in texture (which I find soothing) with good tannic grip on the finish. A classic, well-matured Glenfarclas — and a very good value for its age. (Editor's Choice)",460.0,95,46.0,1.0
80,John Hansell,"A marriage of three casks, one of them an ex-sherry butt. The sherry is certainly evident, and this is more sherried than many of the Cellar Collection whiskies to date. Opulent and seductive, with prominent fruit (glazed spiced oranges, ripe peach, and hints of pineapple and coconut), caramel-coated nuts, and vanilla custard. A peppering of ginger and cinnamon throughout. Coating, soothing finish. Polished and seamless, with no trace of excessive oak. One of the richest -- and finest -- Cellar Collections to date. Anyone willing and able to cough up the bucks for this whisky will be richly rewarded. (Only 240 bottles available in the U.S., beginning June 2010.)",,95,49.0,1.0
83,John Hansell,"Like the William Larue Weller releases a couple years back, I felt that the Stagg releases (after being brought down in strength) were almost too easy-going. Like the new Weller release, this bourbon has improved greatly, to classic status. Clean, balanced notes of toffee, molasses, nougat, polished leather, dates, roasted nuts, cinnamon, subtle summer fruits, teasing mint, ground coffee, nutmeg, and a hint of tobacco. Long, balanced finish. An outstanding bourbon!",65.0,95,70.7,2.0
84,John Hansell,"This whisky has all the positive aspects of a very mature whisky (depth, complexity) without all the negative ones (excessive oak, one-dimensional). Very clean, but oily in texture, with honeyed vanilla, caramel, citrus (tangerine, orange, lemon), nectarine, olive brine, black pepper, ginger, cut grass, mustard seed, and just the hint of teasing smoke. Briny, spicy finish. Wonderful!",400.0,95,53.2,1.0
85,John Hansell,"Distilled in 1986. An excellent old wheated bourbon. Soothing oily texture, with notes of toffee, old rum, nougat, vanilla bean, candied fruit, black raspberry, corn bread, hints of Earl Grey tea, cinnamon, and nutmeg, with a smooth, polished oak finish. I recently reviewed a Pappy Van Winkle Family Reserve 23 year old (bottle #B1986) at 47.8%, which I also thought was outstanding, with a comparable flavor profile (although some earlier bottlings I tasted years ago were heavy on the oak), and it was priced at $220. Given this, you need to ask yourself if you want to pay the extra $130 or so for the higher strength, special decanter, pair of glasses, and wood box that comes with this new ORVW Family Selection. Or not.",350.0,95,57.0,2.0
86,John Hansell,"Very elegant, bright, and silky smooth, with honey-kissed summer fruits, subtle tropical fruit (papaya, coconut, pineapple), gentle caramel, sweet corn, and soothing vanilla, along with a dusting of cinnamon, nutmeg, and crisp mint. Pleasing, gently spicy finish. The most impressive aspect of this whiskey isn’t its variety of flavors (they are fairly traditional for a bourbon this age), it’s their integration and remarkable balance! It’s also perilously drinkable. I can’t speak for the other barrels, but if you can track down some bottles of Barrel No. 1, buy two! You won’t be disappointed. Let me also note what a great value this whiskey is, compared to the way other premium American whiskeys are being priced.",26.0,95,43.3,
90,John Hansell,"Dark and decadent. Notes of old pot still rum, roasted nuts, chocolate fudge, burnished leather, Dundee cake, tobacco, and a hint of damp peat. When I drink this, I feel like I’m sitting in the study of a stately Scottish mansion contemplating a fine, aged Cuban cigar. Royalty in a glass. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)",280.0,95,54.4,1.0
91,John Hansell,"The flavors evolve on the nose and palate, with peat kiln smoke, fresh asphalt, damp earth warehouses, morning-after campfire ash, and old boat dock contrasting nicely with toffee apple, crème caramel, delicate raspberry preserve, and dried citrus. Long, smoky, spicy, briny, seaweed, dirty martini-tinged finish. This whisky comes from a combination of both sherry and bourbon casks, and the marriage works. I also like that it retains some of its youthful brashness, while showing the depth that maturity affords a whisky. A delicious, well-balanced, old-fashioned Laphroaig.(Reviewing this whisky gave me an excuse to open a “fresh” bottle of its predecessor, the 30 year old, and here are my thoughts. The 30 year old is softer, mellower, drier, and more debonair. The 25 year old is bolder, more youthful, more dynamic, richer, and sweeter — bottling at cask strength really helps here. Both whiskies are very nice, but quite different in personality.)",500.0,95,51.2,1.0
92,John Hansell,"Bottled in 2004, but just recently put in circulation here in the U.S. (Very strange.) It’s worth the wait. It’s fresh (even at 22 years old), appetizing, spicy, and briny. There’s a sweet foundation of vanilla wafer and caramel, with a slightly oily texture. White pepper, seaweed, mustard seed, lime, gherkin, and teasing gin botanicals add complexity. Spicy, salty finish. A vibrant, dynamic expression of the shuttered original Clynelish distillery. Quite stunning, actually. Find yourself a bottle before they’re gone!",200.0,95,50.0,1.0
93,John Hansell,"There are two noteworthy items regarding this whiskey. It’s the first barrel-proof whiskey released by Heaven Hill for the U.S. market. It’s also the first of what will be an ongoing series of releases under the “Parker’s Heritage Collection” label. This one is rich, with thick toffee, molasses, vanilla fudge, and Heath bar. It’s also well balanced, with underlying exotic spice, summer fruit, dusty corn, and tobacco to balance the sweeter notes. Long, soothing, finish. A nicely matured bourbon of character and pedigree. (Originally reviewed in Volume 16, No. 4)",80.0,95,61.3,2.0
95,John Hansell,"Cask #3145 is the lighter in color, and the sweet notes that balance the smoke and seaweed are not as deeply caramelized as Cask #3542. I’m tasting hints of shortbread and caramel, which show through the peat smoke, tobacco, toasted nuts, firm spice notes (cinnamon, clove, and mint), and lingering brine. Very complex. Price listed includes the entire Double Barrel 1974 Vintage set.",,95,49.9,1.0
96,John Hansell,"Crown Royal has always been a very stylish, silky smooth whisky. This bottling adds a new dimension in flavor and texture with its cognac cask finishing. A velvety smooth whisky with notes of creamy vanilla, butterscotch, nougat, dried fruit, and gentle spice are well-defined and nicely balanced. Gently sweet, fruity finish. Crown Royal’s best effort to date.",100.0,95,40.0,4.0
97,John Hansell,"Quite fresh and appetizing for a 35 year old whisky, but not too surprising for a Springbank. Notes of creamy vanilla, burnt caramel, coconut custard, brine, and a hint of anise. Complex, vibrant, and well-balanced. Reminds me why I love those old Springers. Devotees will not be disappointed. A stunning whisky! (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.)",300.0,95,50.5,1.0
98,John Hansell,"Amber color. Richly textured (great mouth feel), with vanilla fudge, nougat, ripe citrus, and ginger cake leading to a complex, spicy finish. Great depth on this one. Well-polished. My pick of the lot.",215.0,95,45.7,1.0
99,John Hansell,"Batch #1, while a very good bourbon, didn’t quite seem to reach its potential. The flavors were there, but were not integrated and as cohesive as I would have hoped for in a four-grain, pot-distilled bourbon. Batch #2 has realized this whiskey’s full potential. The flavors I expect are all there, and they are more tightly integrated and polished. It really does taste different than any other bourbon on the market. I particularly enjoy its silky, creamy, nutty sweetness, which is balanced nicely with dry spice notes that peak on the finish. It’s very soothing and enjoyable. A whisky for bourbon and scotch drinkers alike.",85.0,95,46.2,2.0
100,John Hansell,"Creamy, silky texture on the palate. Richer than the flagship Crown Royal, but still quite clean on the palate. Along with creamy vanilla, delicate fruit and floral notes, you’ll also find caramel and butterscotch, a peppering of spice (particularly cinnamon), and light nougat. Silky smooth finish. A benchmark whisky in the traditional Canadian style.",40.0,95,40.0,4.0
101,John Hansell,"With the Ardbeg 17 year old off the market, it’s nice to see a new Ardbeg in the line-up. Uigeadail costs about the same as the Ardbeg 17 did but, with Uigeadail, you’re getting a much more interesting whisky. Uigeadail consists of a marriage of younger whisky (from 1990 and 1993) with much older whisky matured in sherry casks. The marriage works exceptionally well, with the younger whiskies providing the classic Ardbeg intensity many of us have come to expect, while the older whiskies contribute depth, maturity, and complexity. And bottling the whisky at cask-strength without chill-filtration ensures that none of the flavors are stripped out. This is an incredibly complex Islay whisky, with its bonfire smoke, brine, and peppered olive notes balanced by a taming sweetness of vanilla, marshmallow, and toffee. Interwoven notes of candied fruit and sugared almonds round out the palate. Incredibly long finish.",70.0,95,54.2,1.0
102,John Hansell,"It has been quite a while since we’ve seen a new Glenfarclas here in the U.S. but, after tasting this whisky, it was worth the wait. Glenfarclas is a rich, stylish whisky that ages very well, and this 1968 vintage proves it. It is very deep and mature, with complex fruit (sultana, marmalade) layered by sweetness (honey, caramel, and toffee). All those years in oak contribute another dimension to the whisky, providing a dry, oaky spiciness, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco-especially on the finish. Never does the whisky taste tired or excessively woody. It expresses all that is good about an older whisky, without any of the down side. I’m told that most of the 1,400 bottles imported to the U.S. went to the Chicago area. It’s worth taking the extra time to track down a bottle.",200.0,95,,1.0
104,John Hansell,"Very mellow, silky in texture, and on the sweet side for mature bourbon. It’s not bold like Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old, which has much more oak spice and resin. Willett’s foundation of molasses and toffee is accentuated by candied fruit, fig, dusty corn, and tobacco, with mint tea, cinnamon, and vanilla peppered throughout. It’s perilously drinkable. I am impressed how these 20-plus year old Willett rye and bourbon whiskeys maintain their balance and keep the oak in check. Splendid ultra-mature bourbon. (Less than 100 bottles of this were sent to California, and not all the same barrel. Happy hunting.)",175.0,95,45.1,2.0
106,John Hansell,"Bottled in 2001, but still in circulation and (fortunately) just finding its way to me. These Springers from the ‘60s are getting rarer and quite expensive. This is a great example of why they are so coveted -- clean and well matured, with no sign of excessive oak. Elegant sherried fruit dovetails nicely with polished oak and a steady stream of dried spices. Look for citrus, nectarine, red licorice, coconut oil, ripe banana, and vanilla custard with warming cinnamon and brine. Warm, spicy finish. Very polished!",400.0,95,46.0,1.0
107,John Hansell,"Astonishingly fresh and clean for 30 years in oak, and with incredible depth. Slight oily texture. Appetizing brine, with honeyed vanilla, mustard seed, green olive, Seville orange, and lemon zest. Underlying smoke, damp peat, and seaweed. Put simply, Brora at its finest.",400.0,95,55.7,1.0
110,John Hansell,"Bottled to celebrate the 125th Anniversary of the distillery. Classic Bunnahabhain-toffeed and quite nutty. Almost rummy in nature, with rich molasses notes throughout and layers of sweetness. Some salt emerges on occasion, as do notes of honey, coconut, and candied fruit, with a pleasingly dry, gently spicy finish to round everything out. Surprisingly youthful for its age, nicely balanced, and very drinkable. A great Bunnahabhain!",700.0,94,44.9,1.0
111,Gavin Smith,"Introduced to the Highland Park portfolio in 1997. Gentle peat, soft toffee, floral notes, and honey on the beautifully fragrant nose.  Superbly balanced on the velvety palate, with brittle toffee, stewed fruits, peat, honey, and a hint of coffee. Smoke and more toffee mingle in the long, elegant finish.",112.0,94,43.0,1.0
112,Gavin Smith,"The third and most exclusive release in Bowmore’s Vault Legends Collection was matured for 50 years in bourbon hogshead #5675. The nose is fragrant and musky, slightly oily, with orange peel, developing vanilla, and green citrus notes. Intense orange and peach on the palate, with black pepper, aniseed, and sweet oak. Very persistent tangy citrus fruits through the extremely long finish. No negative tannic notes. (74 bottles)",,94,41.5,
113,John Hansell,"Aged in French oak chardonnay barrels for eight years after six years in new charred oak. Notes of vanilla, crème brûlée, butterscotch, toasted coconut, bright fruit, and polished oak. Clean, gently sweet finish. The chardonnay oak aging adds a new dimension without dominating. A distinctive, stylish whisky with excellent balance.",50.0,94,45.0,2.0
114,John Hansell,"The barrel was heated to 102°F for 23 minutes to dry the wood. A lush, silky-textured bourbon and very seductive. Caramel, coconut cream, marzipan, vanilla wafer and bright honeyed fruit abound, while teasing notes of tobacco, anise, subtle mint and a suggestion of bitter chocolate offer intrigue. A broad-shouldered, heavyweight bourbon with plenty of grit.",50.0,94,45.0,2.0
115,John Hansell,"Aged in French oak barrels, in which the staves were air-dried for 24 months. Incredibly rich notes of caramel, chewy toffee, and maple syrup. All this sweetness is balanced nicely by firm, polished oak, and the whiskey is kept lively with delicate candied fruit and crisp mint. Dry, elegant finish.",50.0,94,45.0,2.0
116,John Hansell,"The other whiskeys in the Antique Collection get all the attention but, for the past few years, Eagle Rare 17 year old has been very impressive. This year’s edition features vanilla taffy, caramel almonds, maple syrup, and candy corn, with balancing notes of polished leather, summer fruit, a dusting of cinnamon, mocha, and soft mint. The flavors are nicely integrated with good depth. A rock-solid effort that will not disappoint.",65.0,94,45.0,2.0
117,Gavin Smith,"Previous Broras in the Diageo Special Release series have set the bar remarkably high, and this, the eleventh such bottling, does not disappoint. The component whiskies were distilled during 1976 and 1977 and matured in refill American oak casks. The nose offers lemon and contrasting vanilla and honeycomb aromas. Musty malt and coal in the background. The citrus and honey themes continue into the slightly earthy, peppery palate, while French mustard and coal figure in the drying finish. 1,566 bottles.",645.0,94,48.1,1.0
119,John Hansell,"Deep amber with shades of copper. Background notes of spearmint, marzipan, teaberry, and cinnamon compliment mature, exotic aromas of ripe candied fruit, vanilla, molasses, and leather. Thick, chewy body. Flavors of candied sweetness and ripe fruit up front, yielding to molasses, subtle spices and, ultimately, dry leather. Long, warming, contemplative finish.",300.0,94,49.0,2.0
120,Fred Minnick,"This is the Wild Turkey limited edition bourbon we’ve been waiting for. Only 2,070 bottles exist. Deep amber hues and non-chill filtered, it opens up to straight-from-the-woods campfire smoke, caramel, vanilla, fresh-baked macaroon, leather, woodworking shop, and cigar box. But it’s not a smoke bomb or saturated in sweet; its delicate baking spices meet hatch chile, cinnamon, hints of mint and citrus. It finishes strong and long with a lingering caramel chew.",250.0,94,51.1,2.0
121,Gavin Smith,"This is the 15th Special Releases bottling of Lagavulin 12 year old. Matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is smoky, with kippers, charcuterie, and bonfire embers, offset by berry fruits. On the unctuous palate, smoke blends with vanilla, green apples, and licorice, plus pepper and sea salt. Peppery, ashy peat in the lengthy finish. (Individual reviewer rating: 91)",130.0,94,56.5,1.0
122,John Hansell,"The 11th annual vintage release of Evan Williams and, judging by the taste of this bourbon, there’s no shortage of excellent bourbon to bottle. This is a rich, seductive bourbon. Sticky toffee, maple syrup, and vanilla cream notes up front are followed by candied fruit, refreshing mint, and spicy cinnamon. Dry, resinous oak finish. Kentucky’s answer to a beautifully sherried Speyside single malt scotch. Outstanding!",25.0,94,43.3,2.0
123,Fred Minnick,"Simply beautiful. It’s so complex, with notes of molasses, apple butter, toffee, salt water taffy, hazelnut, burnt brown sugar, crème brûlée, caramel flan, butterscotch, crystallized ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, fenugreek, roasted almonds, and marshmallow. With a drop of water, another complex layer forms with cotton candy and burnt pie crust. In both cases, it finishes extremely long.",200.0,94,62.5,2.0
125,Gavin Smith,"The first bottling of Astar was released in 2008. The 2017 release was matured in casks made of oak from Missouri’s Ozark Mountains. The nose is floral, with rosehips, orange blossom, and milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight. Honey and citrus notes follow. Voluptuous on the palate; sweet, even sugary fresh fruit notes, plus vanilla, cinnamon, and cloves. Drying from coconut to plain chocolate in the lengthy finish. Extremely accomplished. (Individual reviewer rating: 93)",100.0,94,52.5,1.0
126,John Hansell,"The first release of Stagg was our 'American Whiskey of the Year' for 2003. I couldn’t imagine this one being better, but it is. This is a textbook example of what older, more mature bourbon should taste like: great depth and maturity, yet nicely balanced without excessive woodiness on the palate. It is spicier and creamier on the nose than the first bottling with more vanilla tones and not quite as dry on the finish. Indeed, it hints of a softer, gentler side. But with a name like Stagg, it can be nothing more than a hint. Other flavors you’ll enjoy in this bourbon include spearmint, teaberry, candied fruit, leather, and toffee. Given its high proof and reasonable price, it’s also a great value. (Like Campbell’s soup, just add water.)",45.0,94,,2.0
127,John Hansell,"For the past several years, the Stillman’s Dram expression of The Dalmore has been a 30 year old. This new 28 year old expression, besides being two years younger, is also slightly less sherried. In this instance, I feel that both have enhanced the whisky. Trimming back on the sherry and oak allows the whisky’s trademark orange marmalade, complex spice, and briny freshness to shine through. This one is lively, dynamic, evolving, well-balanced, and always entertaining. The best Dalmore Stillman’s Dram in years.",140.0,94,45.0,1.0
128,John Hansell,"Usually the least talked-about in the Antique Collection, but in my opinion certainly of the same caliber. This year’s release proves my point: nutty toffee and rummy molasses notes balanced nicely with dried fruit, cinnamon, polished oak, subtle leather, and tobacco. The oak is kept in check for such an age, and all the flavors work well together. Nicely done!",70.0,94,45.0,2.0
129,John Hansell,"A marriage of two casks (refill hogsheads). Significantly darker in color than the 1968 vintage. Darker (and more serious) in personality, too. Red berries (strawberry, raspberry), rhubarb, plum, oak sap, vanilla bean, smoldering peat, coffee grounds, toasted almond, and dusty malt. The finish is long and contemplative, with notes of polished leather, juicy oak, and telicherry peppercorns. £3,750",6088.0,94,42.2,1.0
130,John Hansell,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.

Nicely balanced flavors, and complex. Spices dance on the palate (cinnamon, clove, nutmeg), balanced by underlying caramel and butterscotch, and subtle honeyed orchard fruit. Lingering, well-rounded finish. A fabulous wheated bourbon!  Price is per 375 ml. Editor's Choice.",47.0,94,45.0,2.0
132,Fred Minnick,"This is an ode to this bourbon’s old-school style that, post-caramel and cinnamon, is balanced with dried blueberries, sweet cornbread, nutmeg, saffron, citrus, and slight hints of chipotle, ginger, and clove. Under the beautiful spice come vanilla cake batter, almond butter, and salt water taffy that walk it to a finish that just doesn’t quit. It’s the vanilla-forward finish that makes this an upper-echelon whiskey. (13,800 bottles for the U.S.)",130.0,94,53.95,2.0
133,Fred Minnick,"Caramel. Caramel. Caramel. It comes early and remains to the finish. In between this caramel sandwich, it’s nutmeg, cinnamon, jasmine, rose petals, baked apples, fudge, pecan pie, peanut brittle, and roasted peanuts. Over a mouth-coating palate, its complexity tingles and every note plays just under the rich and layered caramel that presents itself as a chew on the extremely long finish. This is a must-have sipper.",90.0,94,64.6,2.0
134,John Hansell,"Aged in sherry butts, which is a departure from some of the older Glengoyne vintage samples I have which show more bourbon barrel characteristics. It is a very fruity, spicy, textural dram, with spiced apple, red raspberry, strawberry, plum, golden raisin, fried plantain, and creme brulee. Good grip on the finish, with grape stems and warming spice (cinnamon, cracked peppercorn, and clove). I love the balance on this whisky. It has aged very gracefully. (Limited to 250 bottles worldwide.)",5730.0,94,45.9,1.0

136,John Hansell,"While labeled as a 17 year old, it’s actually 19, distilled way back in 1988. Each year’s release of this whiskey just seems to get better and better. Some of the earlier vintages turned slightly oaky and dry for balance (the 10 year old Single Barrel Eagle Rare whiskeys did too a while back), but Buffalo Trace just keeps on improving the line. Tight, well-balanced notes of molasses, vanilla, candied fruit, and sweet corn, peppered with crisp mint, cinnamon, and polished leather. Eagle Rare 17 is evolving into a whiskey of classic proportion.",55.0,94,45.0,2.0
137,John Hansell,"Matured entirely in oloroso sherry butts, this whisky is chock-full of lush fruit, roasted nuts, deep spice notes, and a hint of damp smoke. It is wonderfully integrated, with incredible depth and maturity without being tired-and it expresses a soothing quality that doesn’t quit. It is stunning throughout and more polished and rounded than the 1968 Vintage released a while back, which, while enjoyable, was a tad sappy and a bit too oaky at times. This whisky is easily one of the 10 best new whiskies for 2005, and worth every penny. Get a bottle while you can.",400.0,94,40.0,1.0
138,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Corby’s latest Lot 40, this one undated, comes from the same distillation batch as the 2012 release, but with a couple of extra years in wood. The familiar flavors are all there: dustiness, sour rye, hard wet slate, floral notes, exotic fruits, sweet spices, and biting white pepper. Over these, time has sprinkled licorice root, dried dates, oatmeal porridge, vanilla, hints of bike tires, and mango peels. Flavors remain fully integrated with faint tannins underscoring a long sour-rye finish. Value Pick.",40.0,94,43.0,4.0
140,Gavin Smith,"Just 160 bottles of 1972 Brora are available through UK World of Whiskies and World Duty Free Group stores. The oldest bottling of Brora to date was distilled using heavily-peated malt. A big hit of oily peat on the early nose, with malt, dried fruit, and black pepper. Mildly medicinal. The palate yields bonfire ash, licorice, honey, more pepper, and well-integrated oak. The finish is long, with peat smoke, plain chocolate, and tannins lingering in harmony. Complex and rewarding. £7,000",11824.0,94,59.1,1.0
141,John Hansell,"Antique amber color. Mature aromas of candied fruit, ripe berries, and black currants, nicely interwoven with toffee, dates, vanilla, and almonds. Reminiscent of aromas found in a candy shop. Fairly rich body, and smooth. Nice balance of flavors, witha gentle sweetness and oaky dryness throughout. An even-keeled whiskey. There are notes of candied fruit, ripe berries, vanilla, marzipan, and dates, with suggestions of sweet corn, vanilla, charcoal, and cinnamon. Becoming dry with a mature finish.",38.0,94,45.0,2.0
143,John Hansell,"A clean, well-rounded bourbon packed with flavor. Deep amber, with tinges of gold. Rich, silky aromas, with thickly textured, seamless flavors on the palate. Incredibly smooth, too, with interwoven notes of toffee, molasses, creamy vanilla, and candy corn. Underlying lush fruit, cinnamon, and fresh mint -- especially on the finish -- round everything out. Some of the previous “extra matured” Wild Turkey whiskeys have occasionally shown their age on the finish, being a little heavy on the oak. Not this one. Nicely done.",90.0,94,50.0,2.0
144,John Hansell,"A special bottling of Wild Turkey to celebrate Master Distiller Jimmy Russell’s 50 years of being in the bourbon business. Jimmy will be proud to be associated with this bottling. In many ways, this bourbon is a lot like Jimmy: mature, yet with plenty of spunk and character, and a pure joy to be with. This is a big, chewy, full-bodied bourbon with lovely sweet notes (maple syrup, molasses, caramel and candied fruit) balanced by dry spice notes (cigars aged in cedar, evergreen, polished leather). For bourbon drinkers who love intensity in their bourbon.",90.0,94,50.5,2.0
146,Dominic Roskrow,"This is the first time I’ve been up for reviews here so I had a game plan: play it cool, mark tightly, let everyone know I’m hard to please. Then they gave me this, the whisky equivalent to front row tickets to Neil Young on his current Twisted Road tour: not just a chance to get up close and personal with an old favorite, but to do so with an old favorite who’s on fire. Laphroaig’s owners are intent on ensuring a big peaty engine for any new release, but this is a monster by anyone’s standards. It’s essentially Quarter Cask finished in oloroso sherry casks, so in addition to the intense charcoal smoke attack there are rich fruity notes; blackcurrant and berries. It’s an evening barbecue whisky. Grill that fish until it’s blackened and crispy, drizzle on lemon, and as the smoke rears up in protest, sip this.

Right away complexity sets in, delivering salted baked almonds, cashews, dried apricot, pistachio gelato, Nutter Butters, salted caramel popcorn, rye toast with brown sugar butter, and sugarcane. Somehow, a drop of water makes it even more complex, amplifying the butterscotch and presenting cinnamon-soaked roasted pecans and almonds. Pure bliss; a must-sip.",60.0,94,63.5,2.0
149,John Hansell,"I like this Bowmore better than all the previous bourbon oak-aged, ultra-mature Bowmore whiskies that have been released over the past fifteen years (there have been several). The oak is always present, but not dominant. The whisky really evolves on the palate, just like the Black Bowmore releases. This emphasis here is on fruit, bright fruit: peach, tangerine, mango, ripe melon, and pineapple. There’s a soft, gentle side to the whisky, too, enhanced by sweeter notes of pancake syrup, orange creamsicle, and white chocolate. Heavy oak notes emerge, along with teasing, earthy smoke, to give the whisky depth and bottom notes. The smoke and oak linger long on the finish. Very contemplative. In short, an outstanding whisky, but not quite reaching the excellence of Black Bowmore.

Hessian and hemp on the early nose, with a whiff of ozone, discreet peat, and old tar. Fragrant and fruity notes develop, with ripe apples, and a hint of honey. The palate is waxy, sweet, and spicy, with heather and ginger. Mildly medicinal and smoky. Dries steadily in the finish to aniseed, black pepper, dark chocolate, and fruity tannins.

Subtler notes of tropical fruit (pineapple, lemon, coconut), demerara sugar, heather, and anise. Polished oak adds structure and contrast, with a very elegant finish.

161,John Hansell,"An exemplary Highland Park. There's certainly plenty of sherry influence in this whisky and it is complementary. (About 2/3 of the whisky was aged on sherry casks, and a lot of these casks were second fill.) The whisky enjoys a delicious foundation of toffee, fruit (lemon, plum, blueberries) and dark chocolate. It continues to develop and evolve on the palate, with emerging notes of heather, nougat, lavender, delicate peat and complex dried spice (especially cinnamon and nutmeg) to balance the sweeter notes. The extra alcohol is also a bonus, providing a drying balance to the whisky's sweetness. Whiskies like this one remind me why I fell in love with whisky in the first place.",350.0,94,48.1,1.0

The classic Balvenie honey note is there, but more reserved, along with graham cracker, vanilla wafer, citrus peel, raspberry (red and black), nectarine, and polished oak. Long, spicy finish.

168,John Hansell,"This new single barrel expression of Knob Creek tastes very similar to the original “small batch” Knob Creek (when brought down to the same alcohol level). If anything, it’s slightly drier, more elegant, not as heavy on the palate, and more sophisticated — but I am reaching here. The similarity is a good thing, because I really enjoy the original expression. Keeping in mind that no two barrels are exactly alike, your decision to purchase the single barrel might just come down to whether you want to pay a little more for a higher strength version, and whether knowing that it might taste a little different than the standard small batch bottling excites you. This is a stylish, big, broad-shouldered bourbon with a thick, sweet foundation (nutty toffee, pot still rum, maple syrup) peppered with spice (cinnamon, but also vanilla and evergreen) and dried fruit. Dry, warming, resinous finish. (Incidentally, I would rate the small batch within a point or two, and the tasting notes would be very similar.)",40.0,94,60.0,2.0
172,John Hansell,"Surprisingly reserved on the oak spice; it tastes like a bourbon half its age. Soothing in nature, with layers of sweetness (honey, vanilla cream, caramel, nougat), lively complex fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe peach, honeydew melon), and gentle cinnamon. Soft, creamy finish. A whiskey that has aged very gracefully. Delicious! (This is a single barrel; every barrel is unique.)",140.0,94,45.0,2.0
173,John Hansell,"A combination of three sherry butts and seven bourbon casks. This is a complex, dynamic whisky, loaded with lush, layered ripe fruit (red berries, tropical fruit, honeyed apricot, raisin), toffee, oak resin, polished leather, and well-defined spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, clove). Long, warming finish. (Exclusive to the U.S.)",250.0,94,50.3,1.0
174,Gavin Smith,"Single cask Aberfeldy bottlings are very few and far between, and this is a stunner! After hogshead maturation the whisky ultimately underwent a period of finishing in an ex-sherry cask prior to bottling. The nose offers sultanas, raisins, and hot chocolate. Developing vanilla and a hint of over-ripe bananas. Finally, burnt sugar and caramel. Insinuating and syrupy on the palate, with apricots, dried fruits, honey, and sherry. Gently spicy and warming, with licorice in the notably long finish. £115",181.0,94,58.1,
175,John Hansell,"No age statement, but distilled in 2000. A great value if you can find it for $80. An aggressive whiskey, but complex too, showing toffee, nougat, dates, black raspberry, dark chocolate, and resinous oak. Leather and tobacco on the finish. Masculine and exciting. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2015 Release.",80.0,94,69.1,2.0
176,John Hansell,"Often overlooked in this portfolio because it isn’t barrel proof. The last few years of this bourbon have been wonderful. This year is no exception, with a bit more spice. Notes of nutty toffee, caramel, creamy vanilla, and pot still rum, with interwoven hints of oak resin, dried spice, tobacco, and honeyed fruit. Hint of barrel char and anise for intrigue. Delicious! (And actually 19 years old, even though it bears the traditional 17 year age statement.) Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2013 Release.",70.0,94,45.0,2.0
178,John Hansell,"The new ultra-mature release, following its 33 year old predecessor (bottled by previous owners). It’s nice to see the higher ABV, given that the 33 year old was only 40%. Very soothing. Quite deep on the nose and viscous (almost sappy) on the palate, with gobs of juicy oak and old oak (its age is obvious but not imposing), dark raisin, black raspberry, orange marmalade, roasted nuts, and freshly roasted coffee beans. All of this is peppered with cinnamon, ginger, and charcoal. Polished leather on the finish. I like that it’s sherried, and the sherry is kept in balance. Those of you who liked the 33 year old will also enjoy this one (assuming you can afford it).",700.0,94,45.8,1.0
179,John Hansell,"Antique amber. The darkest and most decadent of the four. Quite viscous and soothing, with well-layered notes of apple pie, marmalade, and maple syrup balanced by dried fruits, ginger, polished leather, tobacco, and resinous oak. One to sip and savor very slowly. (This whisky is much better than the last ultra-premium release, the Macallan 55 year old in the Lalique Decanter, and thousands of dollars less.)",,94,48.0,1.0
180,Dave Broom,"This is the bomb. Savory and lightly meaty, but sweetened by plum sauce; there’s even some strawberry around the fringes. You could see how with another 30 years this would end up like the ’54. Elegant yet powerful, there’s sandalwood incense, marmalade, even a little dried mango. The distillery’s density is balanced by this fruit. Lush with supple tannins and at its best neat. From a refill butt, this is an exemplary sherried malt. £230",387.0,94,48.0,1.0
181,John Hansell,"Very close to last year’s release in personality, with great balance between the sweetness, spice, and fruit. Nicely structured, with clearly defined notes of toffee, molasses, cinnamon, vanilla bean, dried citrus, brittle mint, roasted nuts, tobacco, and polished leather on the finish. (Editor's Choice)",70.0,94,71.5,2.0
183,John Hansell,"Lush, thick fruit and chewy toffee soothes the assertive notes of earthy peat and leafy bonfire. Underlying smoked nuts, brine, kalamata olives, and tobacco provide continued entertainment. A complex whisky that completely envelops the palate. This is an excellent example of a mature, sherried Bowmore.",500.0,94,51.9,1.0
184,John Hansell,"Another of the Fine Oak series (aged in both bourbon and sherry casks), which will debut in the U.S. in March. Of the five Fine Oak expressions that will be in the U.S. (10, 15, 17, 21, and 30 year old), this is my favorite, slightly besting the 15 year old. Lovely sweet notes (creamy vanilla, light toffee, marshmallow, shortbread, and a kiss of honey) are accompanied by bright fruit (multi-layered citrus) and potpourri of dried spices, along with a hint of nut and wisp of smoke. A very refined and sophisticated whisky.",120.0,94,43.0,1.0
186,John Hansell,"Distilled in 2003. Weller is the wheated bourbon in the Collection, where wheat replaces the rye found in most other bourbons. The sweetness is balanced nicely by a solid peppering of oak spice. Notes of toffee, maple syrup, fig, black raspberry preserve, cinnamon, and vanilla. Lingering oak and polished leather on the finish.",80.0,94,67.3,2.0
187,John Hansell,"Aged in slow-growth wood. I love the balance in this whiskey, with all the flavors presented harmoniously. Rather lively for a bourbon approaching 15 years. Notes of bright fruit (peach, kiwi, golden raisin), soft vanilla, crème caramel, lemon meringue, and coconut macaroon, then drying out nicely to a rather sophisticated, cinnamon-tinged, polished oak finish.",47.0,94,45.0,2.0
188,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Distilled from 90% rye grain and 10% rye malt, Lot No. 40 boldly mingles the galvanizing piquancy of distilled rye grain with the soaring floral fragrance of malted rye, and a fruitiness born of age. It begins with hard, dusty, earthy rye, and sour rye bread, followed by a trio of baking spices: cloves, nutmeg, and blistering ginger. A farm-tinged sourness fades into citrus fruit with velvet tannins. (Canada only)C$40",40.0,94,43.0,4.0
190,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Cask strength Lot No. 40 has been in production at Hiram Walker Distillery for over 75 years for use as flavoring whisky. Finally in bottle, this is more than regular Lot No. 40 amped up. New notes of halva, pansies, blistering spices, tropical fruits, minty candy canes, and peanut skins are layered over the lilacs, rye bread, dark fruits, and slatey rye of its 43% standard release. Long, glowering finish.",60.0,94,53.1,4.0
191,Dave Broom,"There’s precious little reticence about this beast, which leaps out of the glass blowing peat smoke everywhere — then comes raffia, Lapsang Souchong tea, seashore, wet rocks, Elastoplast, talcum powder, bog myrtle (laurel), vetiver, and the aromas of a just-expunged peat bonfire with apples baking on it. Huge and complex, in other words. The palate starts with a fug of smoke being belched at you (non-peat freaks look away, now) then distinct saltiness enlivens the tongue before everything plunges down; intense sweetness takes charge for a moment before it shifts into charred creosoted timbers. This begs for some water, and when it’s added, out comes sandalwood and peat smoke and tar and an orris root-like character — it’s not often I get gin-like notes on Lagavulin, but it’s here — which rolls over you as you roll over and succumb to its power. After this year’s sublime distillery-only bottling, it’s clear that Lagavulin is in a real purple patch. Superb.",109.0,94,56.5,1.0
192,John Hansell,"The sixth and last bottling from the Legacy series. Legacy 6 is a marriage of six casks from 1965, 1970, and 1972. Soft and mellow on the nose and palate, with unbelievably restrained oak for such a mature whisky. Delicious notes of coconut, soothing vanilla, caramel custard, and banana cream, peppered with spice notes of cinnamon, mint, and teaberry that emerge on a soft finish that fades out gently. A fitting end to the Legacy series. I’m sad to see them go.",550.0,94,41.0,1.0
194,Dave Broom,"An extremely limited edition issued at last year’s Islay Jazz Fest, this was chosen by warehouseman Iain McArthur as a prime example of a ‘bodega’ sherry butt (see page XX for more on the ‘bodega’ process). It is, simply, massive, with concentrated soy/balsamic notes combining with hot embers, burning rosemary, fig, coffee, and candied peels. The smokiness is unrestrained on the tongue; all soot, earth, and a rolling wave of deep, pimento-accented meatiness leading to a kippery finish. Magnificent. (Distillery only) £80",127.0,93,55.4,1.0
195,Jonny McCormick,"Containing some precious closed distillery stocks, this feels like the height of luxury with its aromas of clove-studded oranges, cinnamon sticks, rich chocolate, and caramels. It’s slick and mouth-coating, emitting flavors of butter toffee, orange, and melted chocolate, with a nibble of ginger sponge, Jaffa cakes, and clove. It’s smooth and impeccably well mannered. (Global Travel Retail only)",380.0,93,43.0,1.0
196,Dave Broom,"Bowmore lovers rarely get excited about the smokiness of their favorite single malt. Rather, they obsess about the tropical fruits that some old bottlings exhibit. Here is one such example. Initially the nose suggests verjus and linseed oil, but then peachiness rather than beachiness emerges. The smoke hits first on the tongue, backed up with mango and violet, then the tropical elements and the smoke play off each other up until a guava-laden finish. £120",191.0,93,61.6,1.0
199,Fred Minnick,"A 7 year old single barrel. Fruit and flowers jump out of the glass, with caramel popcorn and dried apricot not far behind. Caramel, berry fruit, and baking spices develop into complex and rounded notes of crème brûlée, blackberries, blueberry pie, burnt brown sugar, coconut, and pumpkin pie with extra nutmeg. Long finish delivers a hint of peach cobbler crust. The perfect example of a below 90-proof whiskey with complexity. (Liquor Barn Springhurst exclusive)",40.0,93,44.45,2.0
203,Jonny McCormick,"Sherry cask matured in its entirety, this rich, southern Highland beauty exudes a perfume of deep orange, sweet cherry, plum, nutty fruitcake, and pleasant oak. Beautifully balanced, it showcases sweet orange, red fruits, baked Victoria plum, and brown sugar, while ginger and pepper sparkle across the tongue. Honey and stewed fruits mollify the throat. An absolute joy.",173.0,93,48.0,1.0
204,Gavin Smith,"A triumphant expression including whisky distilled in 1990, 1992, and 1993 and matured in Spanish oak sherry butts. The nose offers creamy sweet sherry, figs, a hint of black treacle, cinnamon, and ripe cherries. The full palate yields sultanas, tangy citrus fruit, sweet oak, roasted chestnuts, and ginger. Lingering bright fruit notes in the finish, with raisins, plain chocolate, and cigar boxes. (1,487 bottles)",750.0,93,48.7,1.0
206,Jonny McCormick,"This has the poise and physique of a classic sherried Macallan. Hazelnut, mixed peel, peach cobbler, and wood spices form a delightful olfactory combination. Warm, weighty sherry notes bathe the mouth with ginger loaf, milk chocolate chunks, and espresso in support, lilting toward a lip-smacking finish of peach melba and amontillado sherry. It’s increasingly rare to find a top-quality aged independent Macallan, so don’t miss out.",560.0,93,43.5,1.0
207,John Hansell,"Antique amber color. Mature complex aromas-especially in wood spice notes. In addition to wood spices, I also found notes of roasted nuts, coconuts, orange marmalade, anise, and subtle brine. Thick and syrupy in texture, with complex flavors that echo its aroma. The depth on the palate is incredible! Long lingering finish.",580.0,93,46.0,1.0
208,John Hansell,"Antique amber color. Ripe, fallen fruit aromas laced with coconut, marshmallow, and almonds. The sherry cask influence is very prominent on the nose, but the Springbank ""brine"" character still manages to fight through. Full bodied, with a soothing texture. Huge flavors with great balance and depth, consisting of exotic fruits, complex wood spices, brine, and coconut. Long, lingering satisfying finish.",200.0,93,46.0,1.0
209,Gavin Smith,"Glenmorangie Pride employs the use of Sauternes barriques to give a 10 year period of secondary maturation to a batch of spirit distilled in 1981. The result is a whisky with an intense, pungent, earthy nose; very complex, with polished old furniture notes, spices, oak tannins, and licorice. The palate is ‘full on’ for a Glenmorangie; waxy, with sherbet, honey, and baked apple, then orange marmalade, sultana, and a hint of smoke in the lengthy finish. Available July 1, 2011. Price is approximate.",,93,56.7,1.0
210,John Hansell,"A significant improvement over the previous release in 2007, which I felt was the weakest of Buffalo Trace’s Antique Collection that year. Wheated bourbons, like William Larue Weller, lack the bold zing of rye, and therefore are vulnerable to being too tame, too easygoing, like the 2007 release. What wheated whiskeys gain in drinkability, they can lose in vibrancy and zest. The distiller might want to augment this, and a good way to do this is by increasing the oak impact (spice, resin, balancing dryness), as was done (quite masterfully, by the way) with this new expression. Sweet notes of vanilla custard, maple syrup, Demerara rum, shortbread cookie, and marzipan are balanced by raspberry jam, cinnamon, nutmeg, teaberry, and gentle oak resin that lingers on the finish. Great balance, too!",65.0,93,62.65,2.0
211,John Hansell,"Deep amber color. Rich, mature aroma of molasses, maple syrup, and leather, with background notes of creamy vanilla, tobacco, and subtle mint. Full, thick, mouth-coating body. Sweet up front (molasses, maple syrup, rich toffee, candied fruit), becoming spicy (vanilla, mint) and then dry with notes of leather and tobacco. Long, dry finish.",38.0,93,45.0,2.0
212,John Hansell,"Complex fruit (clementine, pineapple, golden raisin) balanced nicely with honey, vanilla custard, and dusty corn, along with a sprinkling of cinnamon and nutmeg. An extremely versatile whiskey with its medium weight, easy to embrace personality, and subtle charms. Perennially one of the best values in whiskey. Editor's Choice and Value Pick.",29.0,93,43.3,2.0
213,John Hansell,"I really enjoy these older Eagle Rare whiskeys. They’re big, hearty whiskies that are very traditional in style, but have extra depth on the palate due to the extensive aging. Sweet notes (candy corn and toffee) meld nicely with underlying nuttiness (pecans, almonds), delicate spice (vanilla, cinnamon, mint), and a hint of leather. One of the best Eagle Rares I have ever tasted.",48.0,93,45.0,2.0
214,John Hansell,"Aromatically fruity and quite full, with wonderful depth on the nose and palate. The fruit (golden raisins, apricot, red licorice, papaya) is balanced by restrained honey, vanilla, and fennel. The whisky is always dry but never excessively so. A delicious, ultra-mature whisky.",240.0,93,45.1,1.0
215,John Hansell,"Port Ellen whiskies are just going to keep getting rarer and more expensive. This old-fashioned whisky is beginning to show its age, but is still holding up nicely. It’s clean, with no excessive oak, and a soft, sweet maltiness for balance. Earthy and rooty at times, with tarry rope, beach pebbles, leafy smoke, bourbon barrel char, black licorice, lemon peel, and hints of shellfish and diesel fumes (like following a boat in the ocean). Long, smoky, lightly briny finish.",370.0,93,,1.0
217,Gavin Smith,"This 1979 vintage is the 17th Special Releases Port Ellen. It has been aged in refill American oak hogsheads and butts. The nose offers fresh-mown grass, ripe pears, and damp tweed, before smoked fish and bonfire aromas emerge. The oily palate features spicy peat, barbecued meat, and peaches in syrup. Very long in the finish; smoky and earthy, with a hint of chili and mouth-drying tannins. (2,988 bottles)",,93,51.0,1.0
218,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. Fresh, exciting, spicy aroma of brine, exotic pepper, seaweed, and raw fruit, with interwoven notes of delicate peat and caramel. Full-bodied and muscular. Flavors are incredibly vibrant and dynamic-almost challenging-and are similar to its aroma. Salty, peppery, intense finish.",150.0,93,46.0,1.0
219,John Hansell,"Surprisingly clean and youthful for a 30 year old, both on the nose and palate. Complex, too, with a sea breeze freshness, vanilla malt, polished oak spice, smoked seaweed, lightly tarred boat docks, toasted nuts, and lingering telicherry pepper. Mature, yet still quite powerful. Rivals the original Talisker 25 year old and the Talisker 18 year old as one of the finest Talisker whiskies ever released.",300.0,93,51.9,1.0
220,John Hansell,"A sophisticated and refined Talisker, if that’s not an oxymoron. But this is certainly true when compared to the 10 year old. This 18 year old is deeper too, with less of the fishnets, more of oak boat docks. Less lemongrass, more fruit gum drops. There’s still that knock-out punch on the finish. There’s a fine line between polishing the rough edges of a beautifully powerful whisky and ripping its heart and soul out with a knife by dumbing it down. This whisky has not crossed that line. A fabulous whisky!",65.0,93,45.8,1.0
221,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1982, this expression was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. It is the 16th Brora in the Special Releases series. Ripe pears and vanilla on the nose; progressively more perfumed, with developing toffee notes. Slightly waxy on the palate, with fresh-squeezed lemon and sweet background smoke contrasting with spicy dark berries. Plain chocolate, sultanas, and raisins in the medium-length finish. A relatively restrained Brora. (3,000 bottles)",,93,51.9,1.0
222,Gavin Smith,"This veteran Dalmore was matured successively in bourbon casks, Matusalem oloroso sherry casks, colheita port pipes, more bourbon wood, and finally, Champagne casks. The nose offers orange marmalade, vanilla, milk chocolate, maraschino cherries, white pepper, and a hint of black treacle. Sweet sherry and sultanas on the early palate, with developing prunes and licorice. The finish is extremely long, with increasing licorice, plain chocolate, wood spice, and tannic oak. (50 bottles)",,93,40.0,1.0
223,John Hansell,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Shimmering gold Aroma: Very complex, with a potpourri of spicy, herbal notes. There’s a lot going on here. Nice depth too. Palate: Similar to its aroma, nicely balanced, and evolving. Lingering, spicy finish.",300.0,93,52.9,
225,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Masterson’s bottles singular rye whisky. Yes, this 100% rye-grain whisky is sourced, but finishing by 3 Badge Beverage in French oak casks makes it their own. Booming, gingery spices cavort on a creamy, leathery, almost oily palate. Snappy sour pickles and vague herbal notes contrast pointedly with sweet vanilla and hints of milk chocolate, dried black fruit, and aromatic pipe tobacco.",89.0,93,45.0,4.0
226,John Hansell,"All the current Elijah Craig 20 year old releases in distribution are single barrel offerings. I’ve tasted a few, and they vary to a degree. This is my favorite so far. Yes, there’s a lot of oak here (resinous, spicy, leathery, tobacco-tinged), but it’s on a bed of layered sweetness (nutty toffee, caramel fudge, maple syrup) that supports and marries with the oak. An ideal postprandial bourbon.",130.0,93,45.0,2.0
227,John Hansell,"Antique amber color. Thick, mature aromas of toffee, leather, candied fruit, and mint. The aromas are tightly bound at cask strength but open up with a bit of water to reveal spicy wood resins and a hint of tobacco. Thick, almost chewy in texture. Its flavors are similar to its aroma (and nicely balanced), with the sweeter notes (toffee, candied fruit) up front and the drier, more spicy notes (mint, wood resins, leather) beginning in the middle and continuing to its finish. A lovely balance of flavors and not one bit too old or woody.",45.0,93,68.7,2.0
228,John Hansell,"A thick, lush whisky. Notes of honey-drenched citrus, orange marmalade, chewy toffee and almonds, peppered with that classic coastal brine freshness and background spice I have come to love in Dalmore. Long, contemplative finish. This whisky packs plenty of freshness and liveliness for 30 years on oak and is a pure joy to drink.",250.0,93,42.0,1.0
229,John Hansell,"The fourth limited release Stagg in as many years. While there’s no age statement on the bottle, this one is 16 years old. And in the same vein as its three predecessors, this Stagg is an extremely seamless affair. What impresses me most about the annual Stagg releases is the whiskey’s incredible drinkability at remarkably high alcohol levels. Be stingy when adding water to this whiskey to appreciate its soothingly smooth, oily texture and lovely notes of maple syrup, vanilla cream, dried corn, candied fruit, polished oak, supple leather, pencil shavings, and subtle mint.",47.0,93,65.45,2.0
231,John Hansell,"A marriage of eight casks (seven hogsheads, one sherry butt). A whisky in excellent shape for its age. Very clean and bright on the palate, with no excessive oak. Notes of lemon tart, clementine, plum, honeyed vanilla, and polished oak, peppered with clove, soft mint, marshmallow, and subtle toasted coconut. Clinging, mouth-coating finish.  £2,250",3657.0,93,45.6,1.0
233,John Hansell,"The good news: This is one of the best Highland Park whiskies I have ever tasted. The bad news: it’s the new release for Travel Retail (formerly Duty Free). It’s lush, well-balanced, and very complex. Well-defined notes of toffee, candied fruit, and roasted nuts are accentuated by background honey, chocolate mousse, and smoke. Here’s the icing on the cake: it’s bottled at 47.5%, which really allows the flavors to shine. If you’re going overseas, consider tracking down a bottle.",100.0,93,47.5,1.0
235,John Hansell,"A polished, very elegant expression with subtle complexity throughout. Notes of squeaky-clean fruit (tangerine, peach, nectarine, kiwi) in light syrup. Vibrant spice (cinnamon, white pepper, anise), creamy vanilla, and almond evolve on the palate, leading to a gentle finish. Surprisingly lively for a whisky more than 30 years old. When I think of great Glenrothes vintages, I go back to the 1972 vintage for comparison. Both are comparable in quality, with the 1972 vintage showing darker sugars, more weight, and more roasted nuts.",500.0,93,43.0,1.0
238,John Hansell,"Style: Bourbon Color: Antique amber Aroma: Thick, lush, very complex and nicely balanced. Notes of polished leather and oak marry nicely with the toffee and caramel. Tobacco, raisins, and dates, add complexity and diversity. Palate: Bold and voluptuous, with notes similar to its aroma. Long, soothing finish.
   General Comments: A big, broad-shouldered bourbon jam-packed with flavors that just won't quit. Most bourbons of this age and intensity are too woody. Not this one. It is very well-balanced from beginning to end. Bravo! Price: upper $30s. Available nationwide but produced in limited quantities.",40.0,93,46.5,2.0
240,John Hansell,"Fully matured at 15 years, as you would expect. Lovely array of flavors: candied fruit, cinnamon, nutmeg, gritty oak resins, vanilla fudge, and firm corn. Underlying notes of tobacco and polished leather add complexity and intrigue without dominating, kissed with a touch of honey. A remarkable value, considering its age and strength.",50.0,93,53.5,2.0
241,John Hansell,"Similar in many ways to the 15. Less vibrant, more mature. Less corn, more maple syrup. Less nutmeg, more teaberry. The most elegant, sexy and stylish of the three and the best dovetailing of flavors. You might think that $90 is a lot of money for bourbon, but this whiskey is fairly valued when compared to other spirits of this age.",90.0,93,45.2,
242,John Hansell,"No age statement, but this whiskey was distilled in 1992. At 144.8 proof, this is almost two whiskeys for the price of one. In true Stagg form, this whiskey is dangerously drinkable -- even at higher strength (although you will still need to add copious quantities of water to this supercharged whiskey). Its dominant character is chewy toffee sweetness with maple syrup, vanilla fudge, and nougat. Additional notes of berried fruit, tea, spearmint, and suggestions of tobacco. Very soothing. An incredible value, considering its strength.",55.0,93,72.4,2.0
243,Dave Broom,"Bottled for Friends of the Classic Malts (which means most of you), this is Cragganmore in early autumnal guise. Dry leaves underfoot, ripe black fruits on the bushes, waxed jacket, chestnut, and a whiff of cedary smoke, opening into dried peach. The palate is thickly textured, with those fruits, dark chocolate, and pomegranate molasses. The immensely long finish gives you light pepper, smoke, and blackberry jam. Cragganmore at its very best, and at a great price. £80",135.0,93,48.0,1.0
244,Dave Broom,"OK, confession time. This remains one of my favorite whiskies ever, a classic example of what long, slow aging in a refill cask can do for a whisky — increase its unctuous nature, bring out butterscotch, ginseng, honey, deepen the orchard fruits, and release a dazzling spiciness on the tongue. It has balance, it has finesse, and there’s not much left. £155(Not available in the U.S.)",248.0,93,57.9,1.0
245,Dave Broom,"Deep amber in color with the green glints of first-fill sherry, this has bosky notes and meat—mutton and venison—plus graphite, bitter chocolate, and wet rock before layers of dried stone fruits and date. This is the most savory and Bovril-like of the new range. The palate is feral and earthy; think mushroom with game pie, and rowan berries. Deep, but with more dimensions than the previous 16 year old which, in comparison, seems like a blunt instrument. £180/500 ml",304.0,93,43.4,1.0
246,John Hansell,"Fresh, vibrant, and beautifully complex. A clean, malty foundation accentuated by bright complex fruit, delicate spice, dried flowers, and gentle honeyed vanilla notes that linger on the palate. This is a wonderful whisky which is very versatile, but I can only imagine what it would taste like at 46% and unchill-filtered like the wood finish expressions.",45.0,93,43.0,1.0
247,Dave Broom,"Dark amber in hue, this shows immediate mature elegance with great sweetness — think of spiced honey or mead. There are some light notes of pecan pie and all the while that thread of the sod. Glenfarclas can never fully escape its dark roots. There’s dried peach and fruit leather, toffee, and, with water, biscuits dunked in tea. The palate is autumnal and soft — fruit compote and peppermint. This is what you want from fully mature Glenfarclas at its peak. (A U.S. exclusive).",599.0,93,44.7,1.0
249,Gavin Smith,"Part of the core range from GlenDronach, Parliament has been aged in a mix of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks and is non-chill filtered. Quite sweet sherry on the nose, with fresh leather, nutty peach notes, cloves, and pepper. Rich sherried fruits on the full palate, with more pepper, ginger, and plain chocolate. The finish is long, with licorice and oak tannins. Not to be rushed!",262.0,93,48.0,
250,John Hansell,"An impressive single cask bottling of Glenfiddich. It really shows the natural potential of this distillery. Nothing fancy here, just the pure elegance of Glenfiddich. Notes of shortbread, demerara sugar, and white chocolate, spiced with toasted nuts, cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg. Very clean and polished.",600.0,93,46.5,1.0
251,John Hansell,"Deeper, richer, more viscous, and more intriguing than the 12 year old (and not as sappy as the 18 year old). Complex and intriguing, with raisin, orange marmalade, grape skin, sugar plum, cinnamon bun, raspberry preserve, mixed nuts, and coal ash. Nice tannic grip on the finish. The best of the bunch, and very impressive!",95.0,93,46.0,1.0
252,John Hansell,"Antique copper color, with some streaks of gold. A complex array of dried fruit on the nose, peppered with dried spice, orange marmalade, dark chocolate, and wood shavings. On the palate, the immediate impact is once again marmalade, followed briefly by bramble before drier notes of dark chocolate, wood shavings, anise, and subtle smoke emerge. Dry and spicy on the finish, but never austere. A delicious, contemplative 40 year old Highland Park that has aged gracefully.

This is a permanent addition to the range. Out of curiosity, I tasted it next to the other great Highland Parks (the 30 year old and several very good single cask bottlings over 30 years old). This whisky is in the same league as the others. Its only down side is that it’s a lot more expensive than the others.",1900.0,93,48.3,1.0
253,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Pencil shavings, then vanilla, caramel, barley sugar, and bitter candied orange peel. Mild white pepper persists in a spicy fusion, from which a subtle but energizing pithiness teases out delicate smatterings of cloves, ginger, and allspice. The fruitiness of canned peaches, apricots, and sour green apples adds dimension and balance. Complex and so tightly integrated that rich as it is, individual flavors are little more than nuances. Finish is long and gingery with refreshing citrus pith. (Canada only) C$100",79.0,93,45.0,4.0
255,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Exclusive Malts doesn't disclose the source distillery, which doesn't matter when you’ve got a whisky that’s a gem. Apple cider defines the nose and is complemented by ginger and iris. On the palate this whisky is lush but well balanced, with honeyed apple cider, gingerbread cookie, and baked apple. In the center of all this is rancio. Ginger spice and baked apple define the finish, which is long and flavorful. Great balance, integration, and flavor. What more can you ask for? (U.S. only)",200.0,93,48.8,1.0
256,Fred Minnick,"Fruit bliss. Filled with apple, pear, dried apricot, and peaches, it then offers floral and rich caramel notes. Chocolate fried pie, pumpkin pie, and vanilla custard follow over a creamy mouthfeel. Then nuts set in, including roasted almonds, salted walnuts, and pecans. Honey and malt appear toward the end for a long and wonderful finish with a light hint of cinnamon. Editor’s Choice",110.0,93,50.0,2.0
257,Gavin Smith,"The sixteenth Special Releases Port Ellen is the oldest to date. Initially, sea breeze on the nose, brine, rock pools, and gentle iodine, followed by dried fruits, peat, and wood polish. Full-bodied, very silky, again with brine to the fore, plus sweet peat, drying slowly, ginger, black pepper, and balancing tropical fruit notes. The finish is long, with burnt oak embers and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2,900 bottles)",4000.0,93,55.2,1.0
258,John Hansell,"The fifth in a series of Glenlivet Cellar Collection whiskies. This is a very complex whisky, with exotic notes of oak, sultana, vanilla cream, almonds, and evergreen. These notes are quite floral on the nose and well balanced, with no hint of excessive aging. The palate is polished, deep, and continuously evolving, with a long spicy finish. The oak notes reveal that this whisky has some years on it, but they in no way dominate or detract from the other flavors. An outstanding effort! This rivals the 1959 vintages as the best of the Cellar Collection releases. You’ll need deep pockets, though.",,93,44.7,1.0
259,John Hansell,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas of mature oak, leather, ripe fruit, and toffee, are very deep and well balanced. Its flavors are rich and enveloping, with notes of treacle, toffee, roasted nuts, and a long, spicy, woody finish that lingers.",100.0,93,43.0,1.0
260,Dave Broom,"That rarely-spotted beast Dailuaine gets the Special Release treatment. This example has come from refill American oak and has immediate marzipan notes on top of the distillery’s fascinating mix of meaty density and sweetness. In time there are fat fruits, Victoria plum, bitter citrus, faded green leafiness, and chocolate notes. The palate is ripe, rich, and profound, with a hint of tropical fruits cut with cacao. Long, elegant, and complex, this is the best of this year’s bunch for me.",2000.0,93,50.9,
262,Gavin Smith,"Another Special Releases staple, this is the fifteenth and oldest Brora in the series to date. The nose offers hemp, oiled brown paper, lemon juice, ashy peat, and sweetening malt. The oily palate boasts sweet fruit notes, peaty toffee, and ginger. Long in the softly smoky finish, with black pepper, plain chocolate, char, and licorice. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (2,984 bottles)",2200.0,93,48.6,1.0
263,John Hansell,"Thick, dark, sweet notes of rummy molasses, chewy toffee, fig cake, and some teasing notes of chocolate fudge. Between these layers of sweetness emerge notes of dark berried fruit and glazed citrus. A very seductive, compelling whiskey. Liquid dessert.",55.0,93,64.95,2.0
264,John Hansell,"Straw/honey color. Light to medium weight, with a slightly oily texture. Shy on the nose, but makes up for it on the finish. Fresh brine, toasted coconut, bright citrus fruit, and subtle mint on a bed of vanilla cream and honeyed malt. The peat smoke is restrained on the nose, but is more assertive on the palate, and it really kicks in on the finish, which is briny, smoky, appetizing, and long. The best Longrow since the 1974 vintage. If it would only just open up a little more on the nose it would challenge the best from ‘73 and ‘74. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.)",280.0,93,46.0,1.0
267,Dave Broom,"Full gold. Weighty, but not oppressed by wood. Full, rich rancio aroma, which brings to mind an ancient cognac. It is rich and powerful, but has great finesse and perfect balance: cooked fruit, some spice, a lot of waxiness, licorice…and then the distillery’s signature meatiness. The palate starts sweetly with ripe old autumn fruits, and soft tannins. This has everything you want from a mature whisky, and from Mortlach, with added elegance. Highly recommended. £198",290.0,93,56.6,
269,Gavin Smith,"This cask strength, sherry cask matured expression was released as part of Lagavulin’s bicentennial celebration. The nose offers new leather, tropical fruits, brittle toffee, and brine, backed by spicy peat smoke. Smoky sherry notes open up in time. The rich, well-mannered palate boasts sweet peat, brine, muted sherry, figs, gentle spices, tangerines, and lemons. Becoming more savory in the long, gently smoky, malty finish. Very drinkable at cask strength. A great Lagavulin. (8,000 bottles)",,93,50.9,1.0
271,Dave Broom,"Scarcity and the secondary market have driven prices up, so either buddy-up to a rich guy, or club together to try this. Greater levels of cask interaction have added an extra dimension to a whisky that is often skeletal. The smoke’s in the background, as salted cashew, peppermint, tansy, furniture polish, and smoked meats take center stage. The palate is slowly expanding and smoked, with some chocolate and wax. Finally, a Port Ellen that is truly, classically mature. A killer. (2,964 bottles)",3300.0,93,56.5,1.0
272,Fred Minnick,"When earth meets sweet in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Here, soil tilled deep, fresh-cut grass, and mushrooms meet leather and dark chocolate, followed by dill, oregano, and oak. Caramel and vanilla explode over a heavy dose of cinnamon. There’s more: apple fritters, spice, and saltwater taffy tingle the palate until the long finish introduces, for the first time, a hint of doughy pie crust. A must-have.",150.0,93,52.0,2.0
273,John Hansell,"Finished in first-fill sherry casks for two years. My feeling on any whisky finished in a different cask is this: it should give as much to the flavor profile as it takes away. In this instance, I feel it has, and more. It’s not as nimble as younger versions, but the sherry, along with the extra aging, contributes a silky texture and a richer, fuller dimension to the whisky. I can still detect some of the peach, vanilla, tropical fruit, and honeyed malt I enjoy in younger expressions, but its key flavor components are toffee, honey-dipped citrus, red licorice, chocolate-covered almonds, and fig, along with dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint tea) that emerges on the palate and peaks on the finish. The flavors are seamless and elegantly balanced.",350.0,93,43.0,1.0
274,Susannah Skiver Barton,"A beguiling nose of raisins, dried figs, hazelnuts, white chocolate, brown sugar, and candied ginger, with a rich meatiness that calls to mind braised pork with stewed plums. The palate sings with classic sherry flavors: figs, almonds, hazelnuts, dark chocolate, white pepper, orange peel, and a lithe minerality. As might be expected given the ABV, water may be added with impunity. From an undisclosed Highland distillery, matured in a modified solera system and finished in a PX cask. (464 bottles; U.S. only)",100.0,93,60.2,1.0
276,Gavin Smith,"Ardbeg's first standard release in nearly a decade, An Oa is matured in virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez, and bourbon barrels, with component whiskies married in the distillery's French oak 'Gathering Vat.' The nose offers sweet peat, smoky lemon rind, ginger, and angelica. A soft and sweet palate entry is followed by hot peat, black tea, peppery cloves, and aniseed. Black pepper lingers through the long, smoky finish.",60.0,93,46.6,1.0
277,John Hansell,"Polished and nicely balanced, with caramel as the main note, followed by candied fruit, soft vanilla, sweet corn, and nougat. Subtle spice (ginger, cinnamon) and gentle oak on the finish round out the sweet notes. Easygoing demeanor and very drinkable. Great value too! A very pleasing, versatile bourbon. Value Pick.",27.0,93,43.3,2.0
279,Gavin Smith,"This 32 year old bottling was aged in twelve bourbon barrels and re-casked into fresh bourbon wood in 2009. It offers a nose of canned peaches, dates, marzipan, and a hint of milky coffee. Rich fruit flavors lead on the palate: peach, pineapple, and mango, with vanilla and nutty oak. Slowly drying in the finish, with warming spices. Sometimes good bourbon casks are all you need. (3,000 bottles)",,93,43.7,1.0
282,John Hansell,"Silky smooth. Lush honey notes married with bright orchard fruit and candied tropical fruit. Soft vanilla, mint, and cinnamon round out the palate.  Seamless and perilously drinkable. Proof that a bourbon doesn’t have to be old, high in alcohol, or expensive to be good. Editor's Choice & Value Pick",26.0,93,43.3,2.0
283,John Hansell,"A soothing bourbon, with maple syrup, blackberry preserve, polished leather, roasted nuts, marzipan, vanilla toffee, dusty dates, subtle tobacco, and a hint of pedro ximinez sherry. Soft, flavorful finish. The oak is kept in check, with layered sugars and fruit for balance. The price of admission is steep, but this whiskey is very satisfying.",450.0,93,57.1,2.0
284,John Hansell,"Astar’s flavor profile is similar to Glenmorangie 10 year old in many respects, showing a superb balance of sweetness, fruit, and spice. It’s not as subtle as the 10 year old expression, but it is creamier, richer, and fleshier, with loads of honeyed vanilla, coconut cream pie, toasted almond, vibrant spice (cinnamon, mint), and a basketful of citrus and summer fruits. The fact that it is bottled at 100 British Proof (57.1% abv) just accentuates every flavor and helps to make this whisky quite invigorating. Imagine Glenmorangie 10 year old with a shot of testosterone. I don’t rate very many ten year old (or younger ) whiskies over 90. This whisky has certainly earned it.",85.0,93,57.1,1.0
286,John Hansell,"Often overlooked by collectors because it’s not as high in alcohol as most of its siblings, it’s superior to last year’s release, which I felt brandished more oak on the finish than needed. Caramel, rhum agricole, golden raisin, and dried citrus segue into polished oak, along with a wisp of honey and cinnamon on the finish. Well rounded and subtly complex. An exceptional bourbon. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016.",90.0,93,45.0,2.0
287,John Hansell,"This Sazerac 18 year old is now a distinctly separate whiskey, after several years of releasing whiskey that had been stored in stainless steel to prevent further aging. It doesn’t have as much of the rye zing as previous releases, which may disappoint those hoping for a repeat performance. Still, the new release is richer and sweeter, which I find attractive. Toffee and molasses, yielding to clove, mint, and cinnamon. Polished leather on the finish cuts through the sweetness. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016.",90.0,93,45.0,2.0
288,Fred Minnick,"When complex spice meets complex caramel, it makes for a wonderful American whiskey experience. That’s exactly what happens here with a cadre of baking spices over fruit, such as cinnamon baked apples, nutmeg sprinkled over pears, and peaches dusted with clove, followed by butterscotch, vanilla custard, and crème brûlée. The balanced and brilliant finish stays true to its complexity.",65.0,93,65.5,2.0
289,Fred Minnick,"It packs a beautiful nose, with arcs of chocolate, vanilla wafer, cherry, caramelized brown sugar, baked pears, crème brûlée being torched, and coconut. These notes become concentrated and are complemented by cola, tobacco, spice, toffee, and pepper. Then hazelnut and vanilla coat the mouth, sitting there for a couple of minutes until the end—a supremely long finish. What complexity!",800.0,93,58.1,2.0
290,John Hansell,"Very sophisticated and subtly complex. Perhaps the lightest-colored of the bunch. Fresh, appetizing brine and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, white pepper, and clove) on a bed of soft honey and creamy vanilla, with just a hint of fruit. The notes are bright, clean, and tight. Spicy, briny finish. A beautifully delicate Highland Park. (Bottled for Green’s)",150.0,93,59.8,1.0
291,Fred Minnick,"Whoa...this sherry-finished bourbon offers an up front impression you don’t find in American whiskey: marzipan meets ground-up raw almonds sprinkled over pistachio gelato. Then caramel, nuanced cinnamon, delicate vanilla, and a slight hint of campfire smoke. It’s supremely complex, with the third layer being honey, dried apricot, dried pear, figs, and prunes over a sublime nuttiness and rich caramel. The finish lingers with salted-caramel cashew. If this is the future of barrel-finished American whiskey, let there be more. (Jack Rose Dining Saloon private selection)",100.0,93,53.2,2.0
292,Fred Minnick,"From rickhouse G, floor 5, barrel 136 is a study in caramel. Layered in crème brûlée, salted-caramel cupcake, caramel brownie, caramel apple fritters, caramel popcorn, and the classic caramel chew. Then, complexity: chocolate truffles, nutmeg-dusted hot bananas, ginger ice cream, cinnamon-candied almonds, and warm povitica. It’s so creamy, so rich, and so unrelenting with masterful flavor that the powerfully long and caramel-forward finish is expected. Splendid, must-have sipper. (Lincoln Road Package Store exclusive)",60.0,93,55.0,2.0
293,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A quintessential Canadian whisky that holds fresh-cut lumber, hot white pepper, and creamy oak caramels in delicate balance. Long years in oak have delivered a range of complex flavors that evolve slowly in the glass and on the tongue. Sweet vanilla contrasts with dusty rye, while a drop of pickle juice slowly matures into poached pears with cloves. Dry grain ripens into fresh-baked biscuits before it all fades away in clean oak and citrus pith. C$75",75.0,93,40.0,4.0
294,John Hansell,"Straw-gold color. On the nose, sweet toffee, citrus notes, seaweed, and spice complement a powerful peat smoke infusion. In body, it is thick and oily. On the palate, a somewhat sweet maltiness up front is run over by a powerful peat smoke locomotive. Again, the whisky is enriched with citrus and pear notes, spice, and seaweed. The finish is powerful, long, and warming. The smoke lingers for minutes, if not hours. If you like your Ardbeg to go to a phenolic extreme, you will cherish this one. This big, powerful whisky makes no apologies for its Islay roots. And the fact that this whisky is bottled at 46% ABV just makes this big whisky even bigger.",55.0,93,46.0,1.0
296,John Hansell,"Soft, sweet, and very smooth. Richly textured layers of caramel, toffee, vanilla fudge, nougat, maple syrup, and rhum agricole. Blackberry, date nut bread, cinnamon, subtle cocoa, and nutmeg add complexity. Clean, polished, and perilously drinkable. A delicious wheated bourbon! (Not quite the complexity of the 2009 William Larue Weller (a benchmark wheated bourbon which I rated a 96), but getting close.",80.0,93,63.9,2.0
301,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1988 and finished for an unspecified period in port casks after lengthy maturation in bourbon barrels. Floral, perfumed, and very enticing on the nose. Vanilla fudge, cocktail cherries, polished oak, and gentle spices. Soft and sweet on the palate, with vanilla, overripe orange, cinnamon, and milky coffee. Long and slightly peppery on the finish, with persistent drying fruitiness. Complex and extremely accomplished.",300.0,93,43.0,1.0
302,John Hansell,"Those of you who think Canadian whiskies are thin and bland should give this one a try. No, it’s not a new concept, like Forty Creek. It’s still very much a “traditional” Canadian. But when compared to most Canadian whiskies, it’s richer, creamier, and velvety smooth. The flavors are straightforward — primarily vanilla, with some crème brûlée, toasted marshmallow, tangerine, peaches and cream, and gentle rye spice — but they are clean and well-balanced. A delicious, lighter-style whisky.",50.0,93,40.0,4.0
303,Dave Broom,"The hits just keep on coming for Glenfarclas. Here we see it not only with enormous age but in relaxed mode in terms of oak. You can tell it’s old: the leathery waxiness and exotic fruits of whisky rancio; you can tell it’s Glenfarclas because of the ever-present earthiness, but both are intensified into a new aromatic realm: gentlemen’s barbershop, rowan berry, and images of an old bonfire next to a gingerbread house.

305,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Distilled in May 2001 from a bourbon-style sour mash, this whisky was intended for blending. However, times change and Wiser’s recently vatted all 132 barrels as an Ontario exclusive. High esters, sweet pitchy resins, clean wood, caramel, barley sugar, floral notes, burley tobacco, green grapes, and Granny Smith apples. And that’s just the nose.

307,John Hansell,"The last Balvenie Vintage whisky I tasted that was this old was the exceptional 1966 Vintage. This new vintage has some big shoes (or should I say bottles?) to fill, so how does it stand up to the 1966 Vintage? This 1973 Vintage is equally as impressive. In contrast to the massive, evolving, sherry-influenced 30 year old reviewed below, this one shows more subtlety and finesse. It is also a very clean and polished affair-signs of an obviously excellent cask. A honeyed, malty foundation incorporates notes of dried fruit (orange, lemon), complex spice (vanilla, cinnamon, sandalwood), and subtle herbs. Very contemplative.",400.0,93,,1.0
308,John Hansell,"Deep amber color. Exotic aromas of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, mango). Medium to full in body, and rich in texture. The palate delivers what the aroma promises-honey, vanilla, and more tropical fruit, with a somewhat dry and rather lengthy finish. The Balvenie distillery enjoys an excellent reputation. The older expressions are particularly noteworthy. They age very gracefully. This one is a pure joy to drink.",250.0,93,46.9,1.0
309,John Hansell,"Crisp clove, cool mint, cinnamon, and cocoa mingle with glazed orange, honeyed vanilla, caramel, and maple syrup. Polished oak and leather on the finish balance the sweet, fruity notes. More oak and dried spice when compared to the 2013 release (our American Whiskey of the Year) and, while not quite reaching that caliber (it’s not quite as seamless, drinkable, or complex), it gets close. Very impressive.",90.0,93,55.9,2.0
310,John Hansell,"The youthful, testosterone-laden member of the Antique Collection family. Bold and spicy with cinnamon and clove, but softened and balanced by thick toffee, vanilla, and honeyed orchard fruit. Lush and mouth-coating. An exercise in extremes: bold, muscular spice, along with soothing sweeter notes. While its older sibling, Sazerac 18 year old, expresses a classic “older rye” low-risk profile, Handy pushes the envelope in many directions.

312,Davin de Kergommeaux,"If you worried what would happen when Forty Creek ran out of Canadian oak barrels, you will be pleased to know John Hall found more local oak trees and had new barrels made; this time in Canada. This tightly integrated dram is rich in woody maple syrup, with raisins, almonds, and vanilla ice cream that softens a peppery glow. Silkier than the original, slightly restrained, and ever so quaffable. A longish, pithy finish begs another sip. Still a classic. Editor's Choice.",50.0,93,40.0,4.0
317,John Hansell,"Made from whisky aged in second fill American oak sherry casks, distilled between 1973 to 1987. Richly malty, with honeyed citrus, juicy oak, chocolate fudge, and nougat.

318,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Each fall, whisky lovers in Canada and Texas anticipate John Hall’s new limited edition whisky. This year’s sits squarely in the golden heart of classic Canadian rye. Tingling gingery pepper is bathed in ultra-creamy butterscotch, woody maple syrup, black tea, and barley sugar. Prune juice and ripe dark fruits dissolve into dried apricots and zesty hints of citrus. Then floral rye notes turn dusty, with gentle wisps of willow smoke.

319,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Cinnamon, cloves, ginger, candy sweetness, and strong bitter grapefruit pith overtake an initial dry dusty rye. After years in an assortment of bourbon barrels, new wood is used to tame the rugged rye notes while adding complexity and breadth. The oak has left obvious traces behind, with barrel notes and hints of fresh-cut firewood. Candied, in the vein of Wiser’s Legacy, but sharper, harder, and much crisper.

322,John Hansell,"Bottled to commemorate the 150th Anniversary of Canadian Club whisky. An amazingly fresh and vibrant whisky given its age and delicateness. I feared that, given how light in body traditional Canadian whiskies are, this whisky would be old, tired, and show too much oak (which was true for Crown Royal’s ultra-premium offering, XR). But this isn’t the case. There’s an excellent balance of silky caramel, vanilla icing, dried spice (cinnamon, spearmint), and berried fruit, along with more subtle notes of toffee apple, corn oil, and soft dried oak on the finish. Not as luxurious as Crown Royal’s Cask No. 16, but it shines with its polish and purity.",175.0,93,40.0,4.0

Notes of dried fruit (orange, lemons, pineapple) and wood spices (especially clove), with more than a suggestion of peat smoke. Thick, enveloping texture-like a warm coat on a bitterly cold day. Very mature. One can easily deduce this is a very old whisky-the woodiness is evident on the palate. But it is not in excess. There’s plenty of dried fruit, enticing wood spices, and peat to keep the palate entertained, all the way through to its very long, dry finish.",,93,43.0,1.0
331,Dave Broom,"A sherry-cask Lagavulin, this immediately shows a rich, mellow power with a touch of potter’s wheel, but it needs water to bring out sandalwood, beach bonfire, kombu, Lapsang Souchong, and bog myrtle. The palate is where it shows itself fully; resinous and thick, unctuous even, with that scented pine/juniper tea note shifting into paprika-rubbed ham, membrillo, currants, blackberry.

It’s not surprising that they taste progressively older. My favorite is still the first batch, but this whiskey holds up nicely and shows a similar flavor profile with a bit more wood influence: blackberry jam, nutty toffee, nougat, creamy vanilla, cinnamon, and a touch of polished oak on the finish. Nice texture, too, with good viscosity and grip on the finish.",90.0,93,47.0,
333,John Hansell,"Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey finished in a port pipe. This is veteran master distiller Lincoln Henderson’s newest creation, and it’s a beauty. Richly textured, silky, and well-rounded, with ripe berried fruits, candied tangerine, light toffee, maple syrup, and creamy vanilla, sprinkled with spice (cinnamon, hint of mint). Smooth, silky finish, and dangerously drinkable! The port pipe notes dovetail perfectly. Lovely just the way it is, but it’s begging for a cigar. My only gripe: why not 45 or 50% ABV?

338,John Hansell,"By far the softest and gentlest of the range, and oh so drinkable. Hard to believe that this whisky is 40 years old, actually, as it shows no sign of excessive oak. Instead, there are soothing layers of caramel and toffee as the whisky’s foundation. Add orange marmalade and other juicy citrus fruits, cinnamon spice, graham cracker, and lightly toasted almond. A gentle, subtly sophisticated Dalmore, and an interesting comparison to the much different, more visceral 50 year old. If I were a rich man, I could drink this whisky every day — it’s so easy-going.",,93,40.0,1.0
339,Geoffrey Kleinman,"This single cask, distilled at Highland Park, is an excellent example of why distilleries sell off certain casks. On the nose it’s Highland Park's signature sherry and peat, but on the palate it's a beast. Monster peat smoke surfs on a lush layer of berry and malt. This builds to a peak with smoke, salt, and oak spice, bolstered by the high proof. A smoky, dry finish rounds off a monster whisky, different from Highland Park's style, but very interesting. (Julio’s Liquors only)",140.0,93,59.1,
340,Gavin Smith,"An old Special Releases favorite, this is the fourteenth such Brora bottling. Distilled in 1977 and matured in refill American oak hogsheads, it is the oldest Brora issued by Diageo to date. 2,976 bottles have been released. Leather, ginger, and stewed fruits on the nose, with smoky, dusty aromas. Lighter and fresher than previous veteran releases, with cooking apples, cinnamon, fudge, dried grass, and light peat on the palate. Sweet notes fade, leaving earthy, savory smoke in the long finish.",1925.0,93,50.4,1.0
341,John Hansell,"Full-flavored, confident, and very dynamic. Bright fruit, teasing toffee, complex spices, cereal grain, and underlying light leather notes are all tightly integrated. Think an 11 year old whisky can’t be mature or complex? Think again! A Speyside powerhouse! (Available in the Chicago area.)",80.0,93,60.7,1.0
342,Dave Broom,"Now the one that peat freaks wait patiently for every year, which makes it the bottling that produces the most debate. For me, this is up there with last year’s bottling, which itself ushered in a return to high standards after a slight dropping-off in expressiveness.
This is different, however. Yes, the color is as pale as ever — has anyone ever tasted an over-oaked Port Ellen? — and yes, the nose initially shows all of the distillery’s austere notes: think of a wet fish counter and the sensation of the sea rather than overt ‘fishiness,’ while there’s also a chilled cucumber note. The difference is the sweetness, which is more to the fore, and also, it would seem, a slight dropping-off in massive smokiness. Here the peat is integrated into the whole.
The palate has a numb spot right on the front, then wasabi-like heat coupled with olive oil. Soon the sea rolls in and it stands there like some creature from the Black Lagoon covered with balls of tar, draped in wet seaweed, encrusted with barnacles and clams — and clutching a kipper. But don’t forget the sweetness that spreads across the tongue and slowly drifts into fresh spice and antiseptic. Complex…and there’s a scant 3,000 bottled for the globe. [not available in the U.S.] £280",455.0,93,54.6,1.0
343,John Hansell,"This gem is soft and seductive in personality. It is also very clean and still quite fresh for its age-obviously aged in an excellent cask. You'll find a bed of gentle sweetness, reminding me of coconut cream and vanilla mousse. A mélange of fruit (melon, black raspberries, strawberries) marries perfectly with the sweetness. Fresh brine notes and licorice root emerge on the palate and become more prominent towards the finish. This Legacy III is more polished and rounded, and not as tired or woody when compared to the recent 40 year old bottling. And the 40 year old, at $2,200 a pop, is also about five times more expensive.",430.0,93,40.7,
344,Gavin Smith,"The latest annual limited release is classic and sure to please true aficionados of Macallan. Stewed fruit and old leather on the nose, along with ripe cherries, gingersnaps, and black pepper, before orange marmalade notes develop. Full-bodied, with fragrant sweet orange, milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight, and faint smoke. The finish yields dark chocolate, cherry liqueur, and more pepper. Long and spicy.",294.0,92,43.0,1.0
345,Dave Broom,"Port Ellen’s make was usually filled into old casks to maximize its smoke when used young. To us, therefore, it’s Islay’s most austere malt, yet the guys who worked there all talk of its sweetness. Here, finally, is an example of that. Yes, there’s some wet slate and briny smoke, but it’s balanced by citrus, waxy fruits, and a central sweetness adding complexity. It might have taken a long time to get here, but it was worth the wait. (Editor's Choice)",488.0,92,53.9,1.0
348,John Hansell,"Richer and fuller when compared to the Standard Stave Drying Time variant in this Experimental Collection. Sweeter too, with creamy layers of vanilla and caramel. The extended drying time influence tames the dried spice and oak resin and is proof that extended stave aging really benefits older bourbons that might otherwise be dominated by oak. Sadly, with whiskey in such demand, I doubt many bourbon producers will take the time to age the staves longer. Price per 375 ml.",47.0,92,45.0,2.0
349,John Hansell,"No age statement on the label, but aged for 8 1/2 years. Bottled at the same ABV as its entry proof into the barrel. Lush and mouth-coating. A pleasingly sweet bourbon, with caramel, nougat, and chewy toffee, mixed with ripe orchard fruit, golden raisin, and creamy vanilla. Soothing finish. A wonderful way to end a meal. (With a cigar, perhaps?) This is a beautiful bourbon and a great value given its quality, ABV, and price.",45.0,92,62.5,2.0
350,Fred Minnick,"Think caramel bomb. Once you pass the crème brûlée, caramel chew, and other variations of the confectionary, vanilla custard, pumpkin, toasted pecan, raisins, light German chocolate cake, praline, tobacco, cigar box, sandalwood, and earth surface. It’s mouth-coating, covering every inch, tingling from the palate’s roof to the back of the neck. The incredibly long finish sits there with caramel. The only knock here is that caramel can be overwhelming, but it’s also bourbon’s staple note. (New Hampshire only)",47.0,92,60.0,2.0
353,Fred Minnick,"Think of walking in a prairie meadow at a state fair, the wind curving slight hints of grain, and then an explosion of cotton candy, marshmallow, and florals. Initial earth turns to powerful notes of smoked paprika, maple, salted caramel, and fried bread. Every note is pronounced and beautiful. A strong and long finish follows with an amalgamation of everything tasted, and then cinnamon appears out of nowhere. (Kentucky only)",24.0,92,50.0,2.0
354,John Hansell,"A blend of 7 and 12 year old bourbons, married in new toasted barrels. Vanilla, caramel-coated berries, orchard fruit, cinnamon, soft mint, and teasing toasted coconut-spiked chocolate. Dry, spicy oak finish. Nicely integrated. Excellent combination of youth and maturity.",100.0,92,50.5,2.0
355,John Hansell,"Creamier than the 12-bigger too, with broader shoulders and greater depth. Fairly sweet up front, with vanilla-laced malt, chewy toffee, and ripe fruit. Almond fudge and a hint of espresso add intrigue, while dry wood spice on the finish underpins the whisky's characteristic sweetness. Contemplative and complex.",95.0,92,43.0,1.0
357,Gavin Smith,"One of two recent vintage releases, this 1971 example has been matured in seventeen Spanish oak casks, that yielded a total of 657 bottles. Sweet on the nose, with maple syrup, almonds, and sherry. Soft and insinuating. Becoming progressively smokier. Bold fruit and peat notes on the palate, plus oak, cloves, and dark chocolate notes. Peppery in the long finish, with subtle tannins and persistent citrus fruits.",3700.0,92,46.7,
360,Dave Broom,"Lagavulin from a first-fill sherry butt? There’s unusual. This is huge, fluxing, and complex, mixing saddles and dark chocolate, pu-erh tea and smothered kiln, geranium and velvet, gamey venison and treacle. The smoke is integrated, the fires ember-like, the oak there but not oppressively so. Massive, dense, layered, and complex, this needs time to open. In short, a distillation of Islay and up alongside last year’s Jazz Festival bottling.",624.0,92,52.0,1.0
362,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Not what you’d expect from a malt at this age. Instead of oak dominating the nose, it's citrus in focus, with orange marmalade, candied orange, and even orange blossom. On the palate this whisky is light and delicate, leading with the citrus notes from the nose. This symphony of orange is followed with toffee, ginger, oak, and rancio in a combination that's well balanced and integrated. Unique for its age, a definite treat for those who prefer lighter and more delicate whiskies. (U.S. only, 600 bottles)",600.0,92,43.0,1.0
363,John Hansell,"Aged in Zinfandel barrels for eight years after spending six years in new charred oak. Intriguing spice (mint, cocoa, cinnamon), along with molasses, roasted nuts, and delicately textured fruit (blackberry, boysenberry). Nice interplay between the fruit, sweet notes, and dried spice which emerges on the second half of the palate.",50.0,92,45.0,2.0
364,Dave Broom,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. First-fill sherry wood makes a return here and adds its own rich dried fruitiness — think sultana cake — to the exotic whisky rancio notes of cheese rind, sealing wax, and roasting pheasant. As it opens, there’s fig, some peat smoke, black cherry, and concentrated stone fruits. This exotic/savory/sweet interplay continues on the tongue where there’s a surprising hint of mint and some pear blossom. The finish is long, with apple skin, gingerbread, and walnut. A discreet nod to cognac. £1,250",,92,50.6,1.0
366,Gavin Smith,"Talisker is a Special Releases favorite, and this bottling, the oldest ever marketed by the distillery, is actually the sixteenth. Distillation was in 1977, and maturation has taken place in both American and European oak refill casks. Soft wood smoke, sultana, nutmeg, and chili powder on the nose. Dried fruits, vanilla, and malt merge with more chili and savory notes, plus newly-dug soil on the complex palate. A touch of brine, orange peel, and bonfire in the finish. 3,090 bottles.",850.0,92,54.6,
368,Gavin Smith,"Matured exclusively in sherry-seasoned first-fill European oak casks and bottled at cask strength. The nose yields figs, soft smoke, cinnamon, sugarcane, and rich fruitcake.

(28,000 bottles)",300.0,92,52.9,1.0
369,Lew Bryson,"Rich, multi-layered nose: vanilla, cornmeal, berries (black raspberries, wineberries), and broad-shouldered oak. Powerful, but not overproof hot in the mouth; controlled. The berries sing a high counter-melody over the corn-oak beat as the whole experience rocks along. It’s powerful, sweet, authoritative, and finishes with a reprise of it all: berries, corn, vanilla, and stronger oak. Mature, complete bourbon with a 7 year age statement, and a real sleeper in the Small Batch Collection.",47.0,92,53.5,2.0
371,John Hansell,"Back after a three-year hiatus. Well-rounded, with lovely caramel, creamy vanilla, toasted oak, nougat, and candied fruit, along with a peppering of cinnamon and subtle mint. Pleasant, lingering finish. Great structure with seamless flavors.",120.0,92,45.0,2.0
372,John Hansell,"This whisky starts out rich and lush-both in aroma and on the palate, with notes of fig cake, candied fruit, and sticky toffee pudding. Citrus fruit (orange, lemon, tangerine)-a characteristic that emerges with many older whiskies-cuts through the heft and lushness of this whisky, contributing complexity, balance and drinkability. The whisky continues to evolve, serving up notes of almonds, exotic spice, and polished leather on the finish. An excellent example of what a mature, Speyside whisky should taste like.",160.0,92,42.5,1.0
374,John Hansell,"Comes across initially to me as reserved, perhaps even elegant for a Talisker. Soothing too, with an oily texture. Quite fruity (orange, tangerine, apricot), perhaps even floral, with a delicate pastry sweetness. Then the more traditional Talisker notes kick in -- brine, seaweed, warming pepper -- repeated in the finish. A high-quality Talisker; albeit a bit reserved at times. I love the oily, viscous texture.",200.0,92,54.8,
375,John Hansell,"Clean and complex, showing a matured, somewhat restrained personality for Laphroaig: less medicinal, but more rounded. Tar, pencil shavings, anise, honeyed citrus, Spanish olive brine, and a hint of seaweed and white pepper on a bed of creamy vanilla, caramel, and light nougat. Lingering, satisfying finish. Frustrated by a dearth of 20-plus year old distillery-bottled Laphroaigs? Look no further. Delicious!",250.0,92,47.1,1.0
376,Dave Broom,"Though quiet to start, the impression is of a fog of smoke, balled up within a dunnage
warehouse, ready to erupt to add itself to the cool spearmint and oxidized
nuttiness. The palate is where it shows its class: mature, slowly unfolding and
layered, with Latakia tobacco, menthol, nori, white pepper, pear, and a massive,
tarry Bohea Souchong tea element on the finish. Everything from Lagavulin is
touched with gold at the moment. Try to find a bottle. (distillery only) £99",152.0,92,51.0,1.0
377,John Hansell,"This year’s 1995 Vintage is another delicious treat. It is one of the most richly textured bottlings of the past ten vintages and its flavors meld seamlessly, combining layers of creamy sweetness (chewy toffee, butterscotch, and a touch of corn), spice (mint, vanilla, cinnamon), polished oak, vibrant fruit, and a dusting of cocoa and nutmeg.",25.0,92,43.3,2.0

380,Fred Minnick,"Bright and pronounced caramel in many forms, from rich caramel chews to caramel pudding. Then a spice backbone jumps out, followed by butterscotch, brown sugar, vanilla wafers, jalapeño cornbread, mustard seeds, and peach cobbler. A drop of water makes it even more complex with savory spices—sage, dried parsley, and a hint of rosemary, meeting sweet: more vanilla and butterscotch. With or without water, it finishes long and strong with a hint of pepper.",70.0,92,63.7,2.0
381,Fred Minnick,"Absolutely stellar opening, with blueberries, black currants, and mashed cherries complementing vanilla icing, cornbread, and chocolate-hazelnut wafers. Then it’s salt water taffy, bread pudding, honey, jalapeño poppers, and snickerdoodles. But it does not stop there: baking spices develop toward the end, with bright cinnamon notes coating the long finish. (Barrel No. 5083254 reviewed; 12,000 bottles)",60.0,92,50.0,2.0
382,John Hansell,"Nicely round flavor profile, with complex notes of creamy vanilla, subtle tropical fruit, mocha, fennel seed, and light tobacco. Lingering cinnamon spice and cocoa on the finish. An extremely drinkable whiskey that entertains throughout. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,92,45.0,2.0
384,Dave Broom,"The nose is fascinating, as if dust is cohering into form, and fruity form at that. When it emerges there’s baked banana, fruitcake, citrus peels, passion fruit, mango, mace flower, and nutmeg. A mossy edge anchors it to earth. Even livelier with water, this is a superbly balanced, mature whisky. The palate is pure, with big retronasal impact of the spice. Layered and long, it’s at its best neat; you need the intensity to amplify all the complexity. Superb.",250.0,92,51.6,1.0
385,John Hansell,"The star of the portfolio. A true sipping whisky with elegance and grace. Perhaps the best Tennessee whisky on the market. Honey-soaked corn bread, rhum agricole, ripe nectarine, and glazed citrus. Hint of mint, green tea, and cinnamon. Very polished.",46.0,92,43.0,2.0
386,John Hansell,"A single barrel offering to celebrate Distillery Manager Jim Rudtledge’s 40 years in the industry. Dry, botanical, and teasingly complex, with bright fruit, crisp spice, and complex oak. Its dryness is prevalent throughout-the maturity is evident-but never excessively so, and there’s always a soft interplay of honey and vanilla. A very elegant whiskey.",70.0,92,52.1,
388,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Stalk & Barrel cask strength 100% rye whisky takes rye into innovative new flavor territory. Rye spices, rose water, vanilla, earthy tones, and dark rye bread on first nosing are all typical of rye.

389,John Hansell,"A fuller-bodied, sweeter encounter than Barrel #55-6F reviewed below. More rounded and even-keeled throughout, too! Chewy toffee, rummy molasses, and nougat, with underlying notes of dark, berried fruit, accentuating spice, and supple leather. The heavyweight of the group.",40.0,92,50.0,2.0
391,Davin de Kergommeaux,"So much wood, so beautifully integrated into dry straw, black fruits, and tart, pink grapefruit juice. Dry, with a farmy earthiness, and like the scotch hogsheads it was finished in, bigger than life. Icing sugar, red wine, and floral perfume. WhistlePig was the original U.S.-bottled Canadian 100% flavoring rye and after 4 years flexing in Vermont its muscles are enormous.",300.0,92,60.3,4.0
394,Dave Broom,"Any sherried Laphroaig is welcome, and this does not disappoint. Rich, resinous, medicinal, with underlying soft fruits, the smoke is all-pervading, but never dominant. In other words, it isn’t just complex and balanced, but has that other dimension which elevates it in mind (and marks). With water, there’s antiseptic cream mingling with oxidized fruits and nuts; think manzanilla pasada. The palate shows storm clouds gathering over Texa. Rich dried fruits, cacao, and a ferny lift on the finish. Fantastic. (The Whisky Exchange only)  £100",166.0,92,60.8,1.0
395,Lew Bryson,"An authoritative nose: deep oak structure, cracked corn, warehouse reek. Minty and lively, but deep and almost ponderous at the same time, and not anywhere near as hot as expected. A bare hint of mustiness (which a bit of water helps wash out) keeps it from being truly exceptional, but this verges on greatness. A show-stopper.",199.0,92,58.0,3.0
396,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Another Lock Stock & Barrel all rye-grain whisky from the pot still at Alberta Distillers. To the sweet oak caramels, vanilla, and potent spiciness of new charred American oak barrels, it adds spring flowers, blistering black pepper, and blackstrap molasses. Firewood, Smith Brothers black cough drops, and new leather bring dimension to ever-present cloves and egg-noggy nutmeg. Canada balsam, licorice, cherries, clean oak, and the heat of high proof, then a long, hot, sweet and spicy finish with vegetal undertones.",150.0,92,53.5,4.0
397,John Hansell,"A deep, mature Tomintoul that manages to retain the elegance and drinkability found in younger Tomintoul whiskies. Roasted nuts, lush fruit, suggestions of cherry brandy and orange marmalade layered with rich fudge, toffee, and maple syrup. Soothing finish. Tomintoul can be a simple whisky at a younger age, but this one has matured into a beautifully complex dram. (Bottled for Park Avenue Liquors.)",260.0,92,49.4,1.0
399,John Hansell,"These Stagg releases are becoming legendary. This one, while not the best of the bottlings, maintains the Stagg reputation. When compared with the earlier release in 2005, this Stagg expresses a shade less oak. It’s also more subtle and creamier on the palate. It’s clean, superbly balanced, and very drinkable-even at higher strengths. Light toffee, maple syrup, and caramel corn provide a bed of sweetness. Layered on top are notes of candied fruit, crisp mint, vanilla, and polished oak. Soft finish. Just don’t add too much water to it because the flavors seem to lose their cohesiveness at lower strengths. Drink this whiskey at a strength higher than you normally would to fully appreciate it.",55.0,92,70.3,2.0
400,John Hansell,"The newest member of the portfolio and worth every penny. It’s the distillery’s ""super-premium"" offering, produced in small batches and (for now anyway) small quantities. It is my favorite of the three Dickels from a pure taste perspective, with a lushness, roundness, sophistication and grace not often seen in a bourbon or Tennessee whiskey. All of the flavors of the other two Dickels are in here, and they’re in perfect balance and very tight. (Note: my review was from the first bottling, which was a rectangular-shaped bottle with white lettering. There has since been a second bottling, which I have not yet tasted.)",40.0,92,43.0,2.0
403,John Hansell,"The fourth release (and best so far) in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series. This bourbon was distilled at what was then called the George T. Stagg distillery (now Buffalo Trace) and spent the last several years maturing at Stitzel-Weller. It’s nicely balanced and not over-oaked, with spice (clove, cinnamon), oak resin, and leather, along with sweet notes (honeyed fruit, soft vanilla, coconut custard) and a nice creamy texture. Better than most 20-plus year old bourbons on the market.",120.0,92,45.0,2.0
405,John Hansell,"One of the first wood finishing efforts under Edradour’s new management. Very creamy in texture, with notes of sticky toffee, vanilla fudge, fruit cake, raisin, and burnt almonds. All this sits on a bed of dry, minty, resinous oak. The flavors dovetail nicely, with a soothing, satisfying finish. The port wood finishing adds complexity without dominating.",195.0,92,52.9,1.0
406,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Although the Prichard distillery is located in Lincoln County, it has a special exemption from using the Lincoln County Process and isn’t charcoal filtered.  The nose reflects that with bright aromas including caramel, cinnamon, and oak. The entry is sweet caramel corn followed by soft cinnamon and black pepper with a boost from some oak. A medium, slightly dry finish completes a very flavorful but still extremely easy-drinking Tennessee whiskey. This is the crown jewel of the Prichard distillery line.",45.0,92,40.0,3.0
409,John Hansell,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.

Darker, more intense and mysterious in personality when compared to its two siblings. Notes of barrel char, roasted nuts, polished oak, and tobacco, peppered with dried spice. Fortunately, sweet notes of toffee, maple syrup, and caramel stand up to the dry notes and provide balance. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,92,45.0,
413,John Hansell,"Thirteen years old, but it shows its age nicely. It’s peppered with complex dried spice notes (mint, cinnamon, ginger, vanilla),

Now launching in Canada, Chen upped the bottling strength to 46% to boost the flavor.

Sweet sherry, ripe cherries, marzipan, and white pepper on the nose. Rich and mouth-coating; strong flavor of thick-cut orange marmalade, oloroso sherry, malt, and milk chocolate. The finish features gentle warming spice and lingering Jaffa orange. Plain chocolate and orange notes seem as though they are never going to end! £1,000",,92,45.0,1.0
418,Fred Minnick,"A wonderful beginning of floral, fruit, leather, and oak notes; the start to a truly sensational whiskey. Its round caramel meets florals, stone fruit, honeysuckle, and dried apricot, with hints of dark chocolate, pear, and raw almonds not far behind. But this whiskey is about the spice, from pepper to baking spices; they wander the palate and walk you down a long and lovely finish with a hint of cinnamon apple.",130.0,92,66.0,2.0
419,John Hansell,"Aged 2.5 to 3 years on bourbon casks and then finished in sherry casks for 6 months. Wow, this is quite stunning! Old-fashioned in many respects: oily texture, with rooty, layered peat smoke, coal tar, shoe polish, and hints of wet sheep as the foundation for a complex array of additional flavors: toffee apple, caramel fudge, blackberry jam, golden raisin, grist, bourbon barrel char, and licorice root. Long, smoldering ember, dried herb, light toffee finish. It’s all balanced perfectly, and very mature for its age. If you like smoky whiskies, track one down.

429,Dave Broom,"Rising above the tat issued to celebrate the nuptials of Prince William and Kate Middleton was this extremely limited (1,000 bottles) release from The Macallan. The nose is a mélange of rich fruits, marzipan, and beeswax/resin but it lifts with a drop of water to show apricot and heavy florals.

431,John Hansell,"Beautifully balanced, like Kentucky Vintage, but more complex and with greater depth. It’s also not as boldly dry as Pure Kentucky XO. Rather, it is softer and more seductive.

The aroma is so thick, you almost need a knife to cut through it. Palate: Rich, thick, and chewy in texture-sweeter up front, then drying out towards its finish. Rather bold in flavors that are identical to its aroma, but never overpowering. Soothing, satisfying finish that seems to linger on forever.",75.0,92,52.6,2.0

439,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Finally, an unimpeachable counterpoint to the rally cry against no age statement whisky. Oban Little Bay is everything that Oban 14 is, and more. A rich, fruity, malty nose showcases dried apricot, dark chocolate, and salt. On the palate, Little Bay explodes with flavor, combining malt with orange, chocolate, and blackberry. Clove and oak spice join the party in the mid-palate, which shows superb balance and integration. A long, slightly dry, citrusy spice finish caps off a stunning whisky.",75.0,92,43.0,
441,John Hansell,"Similar to the standard Ardbeg 10 year old, except that a portion of the whisky was aged in heavily charred barrels (referred to as an “alligator” char). An aggressive whisky — even for Ardbeg — with a leathery texture throughout. Dynamic too, with coal tar, soot, bourbon barrel char, espresso, cocoa, licorice root, smoked fish, and a hint of ginger.

Aged in bourbon and sherry casks, the 3rd Chapter exhibits a sweet and sophisticated nose of honey, milk chocolate, Brazil nuts, toffee, and ripe peaches. Supple on the palate, with luscious orange and peach notes, vanilla, oak, and subtle spice. Plain chocolate-coated orange confectionery in the finish, with caramel and ginger. Balanced and delicious! £100",135.0,92,50.8,1.0
444,Dave Broom,"Lagavulin is a classic example of how smoke isn’t a blunt instrument that covers everything in a fog, but an element that works with all the flavors produced in distillation and maturation. Lagavulin isn’t ‘smoky,’ its peat moves into a weird territory of Lapsang Souchong tea and pipe tobacco, fishboxes and kippers. It smells of laurel and light cereal, but is always sweet. The palate shows more creosote, with hints of kelp and a little touch of iodine. Complex.",90.0,92,43.0,1.0
445,Gavin Smith,"This 41 year old single cask was aged in a sherry butt and interacted magnificently with that wood. The nose offers peeled red apples, sultanas, honey, fudge, milk chocolate, and American cream soda. Balanced and harmonious throughout, the palate yields remarkably fresh orchard fruits, pipe tobacco, black pepper, and ginger. Long in the finish, with cinnamon drying to dark chocolate, and slightly smoky, unobtrusively tannic oak. A 1970s classic!",1600.0,92,49.1,1.0
446,John Hansell,"Whiskies distilled at Glenlivet might be easy to find throughout the world, but this is a good thing. Take this one from Duncan Taylor—it’s delicious! It’s elegantly complex, with a tropical accent (coconut, pineapple), strawberries with whipped cream, and caramel-dipped apple. The sweetness is never heavy or cloying, and it’s balanced by lovely dried spice throughout (vanilla, ginger, soft mint, nutmeg), and especially towards the finish. Nicely done!",110.0,92,46.0,1.0
448,Gavin Smith,"Back due to popular demand in the U.S., this new incarnation of the Cigar Malt sees the percentage of ex-oloroso ‘Matusalem’ sherry wood ramped up from 60 to 70 percent. Pass the Partagas! Spicy Christmas cake with rich sherry notes on the nose. Fragrant, with figs, cinnamon, ripe oranges, and glacé cherries. Robust sweet toffee and mango flavors, with oloroso sherry, vanilla, and lively spices. Medium to long in the finish, with ginger, treacle, and licorice.",125.0,92,44.0,1.0

453,Fred Minnick,"A combination of 7 to 12 year old ryed bourbons finished in cabernet sauvignon barrels, it’s a caramel lover’s delight. You’ll find fruit in several forms: cherry, blackberry, black currant juice, and strawberry-rhubarb jam. Vanilla lurks throughout, followed by buttered cinnamon popcorn, apple pie filling, nutmeg, and caramel-drizzled bread pudding. Each pronounced note combines for a savory ride to a long, lasting, and delightful finish. A necessity for barrel-finish fans.",100.0,92,49.3,2.0
454,John Hansell,"I am amazed by how many old, sherried Glen Grant whiskies have been released to the market in the past ten years. (Did the distillery owners at the time also own sherry bodegas, or what?) Anyway, some of these have been dark, decadent, and delicious, and I’ll put this whisky in that category. Chestnut colored, with lush fruit, treacle, dark chocolate, leather, tobacco, roasted walnuts, and cherry cough syrup. A complex, well-structured whisky.",336.0,92,51.5,1.0
455,Fred Minnick,"At 6 years, 4 months, and 6 days, this is beautiful. Honey, cinnamon, and marzipan are the opening trifecta, preparing you for roasted-nut wonders: almond, walnut, and pecan. Then it’s complex crème brûlée, balsamic vinaigrette, salted caramel, molasses, maple syrup, and hints of toasted pine nuts, leather, and anise. With an eyedropper of water, it becomes a caramel bomb. In both cases, long finishes await, with hints of caramel.",70.0,92,64.25,2.0
456,Gavin Smith,"This 44 year old was matured in oloroso casks before being bottled at cask strength in May 2016. Mellow, sherried fruit on the nose, with rose hips, vanilla fudge, almond, honey, and slightly earthy spices. The fragrant palate features an intense blast of ripe fruit, caramel, and sweet spices, while resin develops in time. The medium-length finish offers plain chocolate, raisins, and prunes, with no negative tannins. One of the best Tomatins to date.",4000.0,92,45.8,1.0
457,John Hansell,"A very richly textured Glenrothes. A heavy, honeyed maltiness provides the foundation of this whisky, with interwoven candied fruit notes (orange, tangerine, sultana), red and black licorice, toffee, and toasted almonds. Dry, spicy, oak notes balance its sweetness and provide depth. What impresses me most about this whisky is how it evolves on the palate and continues evolving through its lengthy finish.",160.0,92,43.0,1.0
459,John Hansell,"Glenrothes is one of those Speyside whiskies which matures very gracefully. Recent distillery bottlings (i.e. the 1979 and 1972 vintages) prove this point. This Signatory bottling also demonstrates that Glenrothes has the ability to get older and better. In this offering, the palate-coating, sticky caramel, syrupy maltiness of the whisky is rescued by firm, bold dry oak spice and lush fruit. Delicious toffee and roasted nuts longer on the finish. The 30 years in oak gives this whisky great depth, and bottling the whisky at natural cask strength ensures that the whisky is not cut off at the knees. A soothing post-prandial affair.",220.0,92,50.0,
460,Gavin Smith,"The nose is complex, with almonds, coconut, soft leather, tropical fruits, and stewed black tea. Hints of brine and peat appear.

All the classic Springbank elements merge nicely here.",130.0,92,46.0,
462,Gavin Smith,"Originally filled into 22 third-fill bourbon casks, this 32 year old was re-casked into first-fill bourbon barrels in 2012, then finished in French oak wine barrels.

Long in the finish, with ever-present fruitiness, plus prickly chili notes. (4,200 bottles)",,92,48.7,
463,Dave Broom,"Rich gold. Superb mature nose with subtle whisky rancio, mixing fragrant mango with a little mint, rosewater, and waxiness; there’s even some custard and a whiff of woodsmoke before sandalwood brings back the exotic edge. The palate is delicate with an amazingly fresh acidity that becomes herbal (basil and tarragon).

468,Gavin Smith,"This was initially matured in American oak bourbon barrels, then spent 7 years in 30 year old Matusalem sherry butts before 2 years of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks.

472,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This spicy, scrumptious beauty comprises 60% column distilled rye whisky blended with column and pot distilled wheat whisky in a corn base, each matured in different barrel types. The nose screams “Rye!” while the price screams “Value!” Linseed oil, German rye bread, rosewater, blazing cayenne, and that glorious roughneck whack of rye spices.

476,John Hansell,"Aged for 225 months (18 years, 9 months). Only 225 bottles available, and only at one location: Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center in Bardstown, KY. This is a lot of money for a bourbon, but if you do buy a bottle, you’re going to enjoy it. It’s spicy (especially on the nose), with cinnamon bark, spearmint, and nutmeg. The spice is balanced by an array of sweeter fruit notes (bramble, ripe orchard fruits), vanilla custard, fig, molasses, cola, and charcoal. Soft on the finish. Very polished and well-balanced. It’s much more mellow when compared to Heaven Hill’s other recent ultra-premium release, Parker’s Heritage Collection 27 year old.",500.0,92,63.8,2.0
479,John Hansell,"The second in a series of three high-strength, limited edition Highland Park whiskies, and a rather bold expression. Nicely sherried and noticeably smoky — more than a standard Highland Park. Quite spicy too — with cinnamon, but also ginger and nutmeg. Throw in some toffee apple, Cointreau, and waxed fruit for intrigue. Long, sherried, smoky finish. A very exciting whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£85",132.0,92,55.0,1.0
480,John Hansell,"Aged in a first-fill sherry butt. Soft sherry notes, gentle toffee, golden raisin, green tea with honey, a peppering of spice (cinnamon, red and black licorice, candied ginger, hint of coconut macaroon and brine) and undertones of juicy oak (especially on the finish). Tame, somewhat seductive, and well-rounded. Not overly oaked, and I’m not finding any off notes.

482,John Hansell,"This whisky packs a lot of clean, complex, and well-balanced flavors. It features a creamy, layered, malty-sweet foundation (vanilla, caramel, toffee) chock full of bright fruit (golden raisin, honeyed orchard fruit, currant), rounded out by firm, dried spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, mint) that dances on the palate. Long, warming, spicy finish. Nicely done!",80.0,92,46.0,1.0
483,Gavin Smith,"Matured in a mixture of first-fill American sherry hogsheads and refill sherry butts, this is rich and fragrant on the nose, with dark berries and marzipan, then glacé cherries and wood polish.

Finally, plain chocolate. Superb! £375",485.0,92,44.1,1.0
484,Gavin Smith,"At 29 years old this single cask is one of the best releases to date from the Perthshire distillery. The nose offers geraniums, honey, almonds, and toasted brioche, while the palate is creamy with vanilla, heather, a fresh menthol note, and green apples.

485,Fred Minnick,"Oh boy! Rising rolls, cakes baking in the oven, whipped cream, icing, citrus, and chocolate fill the nose. Then the palate confirms this tapestry of goodness with vanilla cake batter, brown-sugar butter over yeast rolls, caramel icing, and cinnamon sprinkles. If not for a backbone of beautiful spices layered in between, this whiskey stands as a confectionery delight. As it is, the velvety structure, concentrated notes, and long spicy finish make it a must-have sipper.",59.0,92,58.3,
486,John Hansell,"Antique gold, relatively light in color compared to the rest of the Highland Parks reviewed here. Nicely rounded on the nose and palate, and surprisingly youthful for such maturity. Mouth-coating texture. Quite fruity -- especially with some water -- with notes of honey-drenched citrus, sultana, key lime pie, and melon. Caramel and bitter chocolate notes emerge, with the chocolate and a wisp of smoke lingering on the finish. I could drink this all day and never tire of it.

Floral, herbal, and fruity, with charcoal and wet slate, this new addition to the lineup is clearly meant for connoisseurs.

491,John Hansell,"Some of the best intensely smoky, peaty Islay whiskies are balanced with a foundation of malty sweetness. This whisky is an excellent example. A sinewy malt with the classic bold notes of kiln smoke, peat, tarry rope, and coal ash. Sweeter notes of honeyed malt, ripe vanilla, chocolate fudge, and toasted marshmallow temper and sooth the palate, along with background berry confit. The smoke lingers long on the palate. Ardbeg devotees will not be disappointed.",100.0,92,46.0,1.0
494,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A rich luxurious whisky finished in cognac casks, as was the crisper, brighter Cask No. 16 that it replaces. This is the cedary, leathery, tobacco-ish sipping whisky of the private club. Simple toffee and the cherry essence of Beaujolais nouveau evolve into ripe red apples and heavy, dusky, dark fruit with candied citrus peel, bitter almond skins, and hints of oak. Sizzling gingery spice and white pepper linger over textured sandalwood. Defined by its heavy, creamy body.",45.0,92,40.0,
495,Dave Broom,"There are light oaked notes to start, along with Oolong tea and very subtle smoke. These then shift into a mix of cedar and scented blossom. Classic, layered elegance with the cask offering support, not dominance. The fruits have that slightly eerie quality of decay, while the palate is deep and juicy. This is an exemplary, subtle, old whisky with delicate rancio (it’s a little cognac-like), which is given a boost of extra life with a small drop of water. £94",148.0,92,57.6,1.0
497,Fred Minnick,"There’s a lot going on here, and it starts in an unusual place—corn, specifically corn husk, followed by caramel, vanilla, oak, banana, pineapple, crème brûlée, vanilla, a hint of cedar, cherrywood, sautéed porcini mushroom, and cinnamon. Over a mouth coating texture, the velvety structure drips down the jawline, offering butterscotch, paprika, nutmeg, baked apple pie, bread pudding, caramel chew, roasted walnuts, and baking spice, which lingers over a long finish.

It’s nicely matured, deftly balanced, and complex, with a wide range of fruit, layered sweetness, and a cabinet full of spice, especially mint.

Great bourbon, honoring a great master distiller.",90.0,92,48.0,2.0
500,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A captivating nose presents hints of polished leather shoes and clean oak. Less sweet than expected, Entrapment goes straight to long-evolved high esters, dried figs and dates, green fruits, and soaring fruity floral notes. Its spicy finish lasts forever. This very complex and tightly integrated whisky has all the woody, acetone-like glories of long-aged scotches. Then finally, some barley sugar, but only after sitting long in the glass.",150.0,92,41.0,4.0
502,John Hansell,"Some of these old G&M Strathisla whiskies are quite lovely, and this is one of them. It’s gently sherried, soothingly oily in texture, and complex, with notes of maple syrup, candied fruit, plum, roasted nuts, polished leather, and old oak, along with some damp earth, coffee bean, cinnamon, mint, and subtle, teasing kiln smoke. It’s soft, rounded, and still holds up nicely for a 44 year old whisky. If you like old, sherried Speysiders that aren’t overly oaked or sherried, you’ll like this one. If only it was bottled at 43% or 46% (or at natural cask strength, if it was less than 43%). It would give the whisky a little more backbone, and I might have bumped my rating up to the mid-90s.",275.0,92,40.0,1.0
503,Gavin Smith,"This limited release was matured in 60% refill sherry butts and 40% fresh bourbon barrels. Initially sweet vanilla and ripe apple notes on the nose, giving way to chimney soot and dry peat.

504,John Hansell,"A first-fill sherry cask bottling (one cask, exclusive to North America). Some of the old Glenglassaugh whiskies can be very delicious, and this is one of them. It's very clean, lush, and fruity (bramble, citrus, golden raisin), with a kiss of honey, toffee, and soft spice. Elegantly sherried; it’s never cloying.

509,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Fifty years on, the standard Canadian Club becomes very complex and in-your-face delicious. Barley sugar sweetness blossoms into creamy caramel in a dark, heavy, full-bodied whisky with cinnamon, hot chewing tobacco, and sizzling spice. Acetone, dry wood, and peaches on the nose give way to musty perfumed sandalwood and fresh crisp oak, with glowing embers in the throat.

Again the honey and vanilla, which marries beautifully with the floral, herbal, subtly fruity notes. Almonds and dried spice on the finish.",150.0,92,46.0,1.0
515,John Hansell,"A seductive Dalmore. Very fruity too, with Seville orange, peaches in syrup, clementine, pineapple, and bramble. Sugared almond, powdered vanilla, ginger, and lush sherry on the finish add depth and dimension. Consistent on the nose and palate, and with great balance. I’m glad they stopped the amoroso finishing when they did. I feel that any more sherry influence here would have been counterproductive. Very lovely!",,92,42.0,1.0
517,John Hansell,"A special bottling to celebrate a major distillery expansion in 2010. So nice to see this whisky bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. Silky smooth, velvety texture. Creamy sweet foundation of vanilla fudge and caramel-coated almond. Plenty of fruit, too (golden raisin, honeyed peach, ripe nectarine, hint of banana bread). Richly textured, good weight (but not cloying), and the flavors combine seamlessly. A celebratory whisky indeed.",375.0,92,55.6,1.0
518,John Hansell,"This is the heavily peated expression of BenRiach. (BenRiach does not differentiate their peated expressions with a different name, as Springbank does with Longrow, or Tobermory with Ledaig.) It’s also finished with the dark, lush “PX” sherry. Both influences are very evident, with the deep, heavy, earthy, smoky notes complemented by dark, fleshy, dried fruit. I think the two different influences marry very nicely here and I really enjoy drinking it. (Bottling at cask strength is a bonus!)",95.0,92,52.3,1.0
519,John Hansell,"Aged in a refill American oak cask. Quite lively for its age, and the oak (surprisingly and happily) plays a supporting role rather than dominating.

523,Dave Broom,"Quite earthy, with orris root, burlap, and dunnage warehouse notes.  Distinctly meaty—Bovril (beef stock)—then cedary. This untamed edge—think Mortlach or Benrinnes—dominates the palate, but the cask (a refill butt) isn’t overstating its presence. There’s espresso on the finish.

Baked apples, canned pears, blackberries, and strawberry jam meet white pepper, followed by roasted walnuts and honey. Then resounding nutmeg appears, with slight hints of smoke, chipotle, and earth. The long finish rekindles the caramel note from the beginning. Must-have sipper.",130.0,92,61.0,2.0

Delightful to sip.",60.0,92,50.0,2.0
528,John Hansell,"Mahogany color. Medium to full in body, and rich. Aroma and flavors are very reminiscent of the ""Black Bowmore"" releases: burnt fruit, roasted nuts, fruit cake, polished leather, wood resin, and just a teasing of smoke. There is a harmonious balance between the dry oak spices and the sweet, fruity oloroso sherry notes. Soothing finish.
   Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: Approx. $1,500. Only 300 bottles, available this fall at specialty retailers nationwide. 
   This whisky was distilled around the same time-and is very similar in flavor profile-as the legendary ""Black Bowmore"" whiskies released several years ago. Comparing this release with the Black Bowmore is only natural. Having tried this whisky next to the previous Black Bowmores, I can happily say that this whisky is as good as they are (although a lot more expensive). While the original Black Bowmore whiskies are a little bigger and fuller in body (especially towards the finish), this new 1964 Vintage is a tad softer, sweeter, more rounded, and more seductive. This is a very contemplative whisky-the more attention you devote to it, the more pleasure it gives you.",1500.0,92,,1.0

531,John Hansell,"Deep amber color. Complex aromas of lush fruit (orange, lemon, red currant) and oak spices (cinnamon, clove, and licorice). Rich, silky body.

533,John Hansell,"This is my favorite of the three. For about $20 more, you get a richer, much more complex whisky than the 10 year old, and it is more balanced than the 21 year old. This 15 is drier than the 10, with lovely floral and spice notes (cinnamon, coriander, dried orange peel, lavender, rose), balanced by honey-laced complex fruit, and a dry, dark chocolate/orange marmalade finish.",65.0,92,43.0,1.0
535,Dominic Roskrow,"This isn’t quite a distillery-only bottling so much as a bottle only available at the distillery — which isn’t exactly the same thing. Bottled more than 10 years ago to mark the distillery’s centenary, incredibly a small amount is still available, and it is well worth pursuing.
Until relatively recently Ardmore was an industry secret, cherished by those in the know. But the peaty and feisty no-age-statement Ardmore Traditional has introduced the malt to a new generation of drinkers, and last year’s sweet and fruity 25 year old suggested that the distillery has a potentially diverse range of future treasures to be excited about. This bottling is light, soft, sweet, and juicy. Orange flavors and peat team up to steer a middle way for what is a delicious and highly more-ish malt. Its only flaw is in the finish, which dies away too quickly for this palate. Perhaps a slightly higher strength would have improved it. No matter, it’s like the fade out of the guitar solo at the end of your favorite track; it’s a bit frustrating because you want it to go on and on, but it doesn’t stop you going back and listening to it all again.",155.0,92,40.0,1.0

Big-bodied, with lots of peat accompanied by chili and smoked bacon, with sweeter notes of malt, fudge, and apple. A hint of fabric Elastoplast. Long in the finish, with rock pools, bonfire ash, and sweet, tingling spice notes which carry to the very end. A powerful beast, even by Talisker standards. (3,000 bottles).",600.0,92,56.1,1.0
537,Gavin Smith,"This is comprised of whisky aged in a bourbon barrel, a 30 year old Matusalem sherry butt, and a Colheita port pipe.

Dries very slowly in the finish, with persistent orange, a sprinkling of black pepper, and a suggestion of mouth-drying oak. (1,000 bottles per year for five years)",,92,40.0,1.0
538,Gavin Smith,"The first release in Glenmorangie’s new Vintage Collection, named Bond House No.1 after the 19th century warehouse that became the distillery’s new stillhouse in 1990.

Attractive soft oak notes and gentle herbal spice in the medium to long finish.",615.0,92,43.0,1.0
539,John Hansell,"From a sherry cask. Bright and lively. Quite fruity, with notes of golden raisin, pineapple, nectarine, and tangerine. The fruit is balanced by honeyed malt and light caramel.

The nose offers sweet sherry, maraschino cherries, honey, sponge cake, marzipan, and soft fudge, turning to caramel in time, with a whiff of worn leather. Slick in the mouth, with spicy dried fruit, and more marzipan and cherries. Long in the finish with plain chocolate cherry liqueur; still spicy. Finally a buttery, bourbon-like note. No negative cask connotations in this well-balanced after-dinner dram.",4640.0,92,46.8,1.0
541,John Hansell,"Deep amber, mahogany color. Very mature and well-balanced. Notes of maple syrup on pancakes, roasted chestnuts, dates, pot still rum, burnished leather, maduro tobacco, and subtle Moroccan spice. Soft, stately finish.

This is a very nice example of the genre.",250.0,92,43.0,1.0
542,Dave Broom,"A vatting of selected casks located at Balvenie’s No. 24 warehouse in Dufftown, this is made up of seven ex-bourbon casks and three butts whose ages range from 1967 to 1989, all of which are then ‘married’ in a large vat (aka a ‘tun’). There’s classic Balvenie honey, along with macadamia, pistachio, and caramelized fruits. As it opens, it shifts into a high-class gentleman’s cologne: musk and sandalwood with some mulberry to add depth. Elegant and magnificent. £165",263.0,92,50.6,1.0
543,John Hansell,"This is a five year old expression of the more highly peated Bruichladdich whisky being referred to as Port Charlotte (named after the now-silent distillery down the road from Bruichladdich). More highly peated indeed. If you like your smoky Islay whiskies young and masculine, this one is for you. It’s like sticking your head in a peat-fired kiln. But there’s more to this whisky than massive smoke. There are underlying notes of kippers, soot, and tar. With further investigation, there are spice notes of black pepper and black licorice stick. What really makes this whisky multi-dimensional and balanced is its sweet underbelly of thick toffee, jammy fruit, and almond butter. Youthful, but not immature.",120.0,92,63.5,1.0

In time, a little fresh mushroom. Complex. Soft on the tongue, so you need to concentrate on what’s happening. Later becomes minty, with supple tannins and a little artichoke on the finish. Water needs to be handled carefully to bring out green herbal notes. I’d probably keep water on the side. Excellent. (Travel Retail only) £250",383.0,92,43.0,1.0
548,John Hansell,"I wish the owners of Strathisla would put out older expressions of their whisky, and here’s why. Layers of sweetness (caramel in particular, but also honey and toffee) dovetail beautifully with an array of lush fruit (orange, apricot, golden raisin, fruit gumdrops). All this is underpinned by subtle dried spice (cinnamon, cool mint, nutmeg) and teasing oak resin on the finish. What’s most impressive here isn’t the laundry list of flavors (although they certainly are there), but rather the balance. This, and its lovely depth, with no signs of lethargy. Impressive!",205.0,92,41.1,1.0

Notes of caramel/butterscotch-coated citrus (lemon, Clementine) honeyed tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), peaches and cream, creamy vanilla, and ripe barley, along with more subtle smoke, cut grass, and ginger. Firm, dry, resinous grip on the finish keeps all the sweetness in check. Rather expensive for its age, but not for its quality. Very impressive for a 12 year old!

Spicy oak, caramel, citrus fruits, and aniseed in the lengthy finish.",125.0,92,43.0,1.0
551,John Hansell,"We’re drinking liquid history here. Antique gold color. Aromas of dried citrus, lemongrass, and ginger with background honeyed vanilla, dried herb, bouquet of roses, and a wisp of smoke. Very long and evolving on the palate, going from sweet to dry: vanilla custard, crème brulee, white chocolate, candied citrus, juicy oak, polished leather, dried tobacco, and then resinous oak, with teasing dry roasted nuts and hint of peat bog throughout. Long dry, resinous finish. Remarkably well-maintained for its age. I can tell that it’s an old whisky, but it shows good complexity. It’s not tired and excessively oaked.
When compared to the 30 year old and 40 year old expressions, it’s actually more vibrant and youthful than the 40 sample I have. Yet it doesn’t have the deft balance and roundness which I consider a hallmark of the 30. Bottom line here: Anyone who can afford this whisky and actually drinks it will not be disappointed. It’s really nice. But for us regular folk, try to pick up a 30 year old Glenfiddich if you can find one and you won’t go wrong with the whisky — or the price (relatively speaking, that is).",,92,46.1,1.0

Creamy caramel, crème brûlée, anise, and subtle toasted marshmallow add complexity, as does its gently spicy, pleasingly dry finish. Two years older than the standard 16 year old Nadurra (which I like for its vibrancy and freshness).

To celebrate, they have vatted together a cask from 1952 with one each from the following five decades — and released it at an exceptionally reasonable price! The nose has a lift of struck match immediately followed by cedar, pomegranate, blackberry jam, and Seville orange.

A very mature whisky with evolutions of flavors-toffee, caramel, fudge, nuts, fruitcake, and a long finish that dries out very nicely. Older expressions of Bunnahabhain are often quite delicious, and this one is no exception.

A deeply-woody spiced nose featuring cinnamon and caramel advertises a power punch whiskey, but on the palate there's no punch. Instead, it’s lush, round, and affable, with deep caramel and cinnamon co-mingling with peanut. The lush, sweet start is well-balanced by cinnamon spice, which ramps up and drives a long spicy finish. This is delicious whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)",50.0,91,50.5,2.0

Nose is hot for the proof, with oak, dried barrel drool, warm dried corn, tobacco barn, and teaberry. Entry is not hot; rather, a thread of sweet syrup spreads out into thoroughly integrated corn and oak. Finish slides into drier oak.

Indeed, I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience.

all pitch, furs, and gun oil. Some mint hangs around in the background
alongside eucalyptus. This is an earthy, in-your-face Ardbeg with a hint of
box-fresh sneakers indicating some youthfulness. The mouth is thick and chewy:

years. Editor's Choice.",100.0,91,52.1,1.0

than oak here, a smoke like the aroma of a fire clinging to a tweed jacket. A
note akin to wilting spinach gives way to more conventional strawberries and
cream, but always mixed with seashore breezes. This is Caol Ila in deep and
bold mood with green fig, banana, and a sweet center. Water gives greater

The pedro ximinez cask finish certainly gives as much as it takes away when compared to the benchmark 16 year old. An array of complex ripe fruit, interwoven with notes of pot still rum, toffee, tar, seaweed, and brine on the finish.

Barley, damp earth, sea salt, and citrus fruits on the lightly peated nose. The buttery palate yields spicy peat, orchard fruits, and more earthiness, closing with smoky lemon.",135.0,91,54.3,1.0
625,Dave Broom,"Powerful and rich to begin with. Some raisin syrup backed with clean, apple-like acidity adding some freshness. This swells into a deep but refined musky apple/pear note with some black fruits behind. Highly complex, but full of distillery character. Water brings out a note like freshly-applied varnish. The palate is smooth, gentle, and deep. A classic mature Linkwood with all of the distillery character on show in perfect alliance with the cask.",300.0,91,51.1,
626,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. Incredibly complex, subtle aromas of vanilla, honey, marshmallow, tropical fruit (pineapple, peaches, coconut), floral notes and a hint of almonds. Medium-full in body, and firm. On the palate, the flavors are complex and exhibit the same notes as the aroma, starting out gently sweet, but gradually becoming fruity and eventually drying out on the finish.",150.0,91,46.0,1.0
627,Dave Broom,"This is the bigger, spicier, and more complex of the pair (see below). A prickly start leads to heavy peat smoke, pink and Szechuan peppercorns, vanilla, dark chocolate, angelica, then seaweed. The palate is oily, with a detonation of gunpowdery peat, licorice, smoked eel, and a feral edge that adds grunt. Layered and complex.",110.0,91,55.0,1.0
629,Gavin Smith,"The oldest of the fifteen expressions in Batch 16 of GlenDronach’s single cask release program, this cask-strength offering has been matured for 26 years in a Pedro Ximénez sherry puncheon. The nose yields fresh-from-the-oven Christmas cake, cherries, nutmeg, and sweet leather. Viscous on the palate, with dark sherry, raisins, plain chocolate, tangy orange, and caramel. Prickly chili and dates in the long finish. (546 bottles) £310",418.0,91,49.9,1.0
631,Gavin Smith,"New for 2017, this was matured for 17 years in bourbon casks before being finished in oloroso sherry casks for 1 year. The nose is fragrant, with prunes, oranges, vanilla, and faint wood polish. Ultimately, ozone. Silky palate delivery, with sweet sherry, honey, and dark chocolate-coated orange fondant creams, then a note of angelica. The finish offers spicy plain chocolate and a suggestion of sea salt. £86",113.0,91,46.0,1.0
633,Gavin Smith,"Dalmore launched a trio of vintages finished in tawny port pipes. The pick of the bunch is the oldest, distilled in 1996, which displays a confident, rich nose of raisins, mildly smoky prunes, vanilla, and blood orange. Full-bodied in the mouth, with red berry fruits, ginger, white pepper, and spicy oak. Medium-length in the finish, with coffee-soaked oak, figs, and damsons at the close. £450",592.0,91,45.0,1.0
634,Gavin Smith,"This limited edition 20 year old assemblage was matured in bourbon barrels, sherry casks, Cabernet Franc casks, Cabernet Sauvignon casks, and Pinot Noir barriques. Rich and sweet on the nose, with marzipan, apricot jam, and fresh pineapple with vanilla custard. Silky, with ginger, cherries, and caramel on the palate. The finish is long, with black pepper, licorice, and slightly tannic oak. (5,000 bottles) £120",158.0,91,51.0,1.0
636,John Hansell,"The first four-grain, 100% copper pot-distilled bourbon in many decades. The flavors are distinctive, silky-textured, and seamless. Bright fruit notes of berries and citrus are balanced nicely by maple syrup, caramel and toffee. The whiskey is quite nutty too and delicately spiced with vanilla, mint, and cinnamon. It finishes pleasingly smooth and polished.",80.0,91,46.2,
637,Dave Broom,"Only 60 bottles have been released from this 60 year old first-fill sherry cask. Amazingly, the nose is not dominated by wood, but is mature and concentrated with the aroma of rain-moistened tweed, tropical fruit, blonde tobacco, cedar, and chanterelle mushroom. This elegantly faded, sepia-tinted impression continues on the tongue: fine-boned, mossy, clean, and slowly drying. A classic example of oxidation, not woodiness, allowing
freshness to be retained. Amazing. (The Whisky Exchange exclusive.) £6,000",9500.0,91,51.1,1.0
638,Dave Broom,"Here we see a significant step-change from the progression of 13 to 19 (see below). Now, there is added spice, ripe fresh cooked and dried fruits, and a touch of the peat smoke that used to be lightly added. With water, a mix of maple syrup and waxiness comes through. Complex and deep. The palate remains thick and silky, with melted white chocolate before lilies make an appearance alongside baked pineapple. Structured, layered, long, and elegant. £337",536.0,91,46.0,1.0
639,John Hansell,"Aged in a Cabernet Franc barrel for 8 years after spending 6 years in new charred oak barrels. Bright amber, with maple syrup, vanilla, candy corn, white chocolate, cinnamon, and ripe berried fruit. Nice tannic grip, especially on the finish. Great balance between the sweetness, fruit, and tannins. This is what finishing is all about: giving more than it takes away (or masks). Nicely done!",47.0,91,45.0,2.0
640,Dave Broom,"Deep amber. Generous sweet sherried nose; very ripe, with dried orchard fruits, chestnut puree, and indeed chestnut honey, then a little touch of meat and a pungency akin to Guyanan pot still rum. Sumptuous. As it opens there’s a fluxing mix of sticky toffee, game, pomegranate, and dried red fruits. The palate is deeply savory, with floor polish and cooked plums, finishing with fragrant pepper. The cask has a huge say in things, but the spirit copes. Excellent. £191",280.0,91,57.1,1.0
641,Dave Broom,"Apparently this is the final Supernova release and the Ardbeg team has ensured it goes out with all guns blazing. Although it seems calm initially—there’s a minty and sweet spicy element to the fore—the smoke begins to push through in the guise of creosote, then sootiness which, in turn, mingles with seaweed aromas. The peat dominates the palate but there is sufficient oiliness to round it out and add layers of smoked fish, and dried grasses. Farewell.",160.0,91,54.3,1.0
642,Gavin Smith,"The latest Balblair release is a 1995 vintage expression, exclusive to global travel retail outlets. Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, Balblair 1995 is non-chill filtered and naturally colored. Initially very fruity on the nose, with peaches and carnations, icing sugar on bonbons, then a faint sprinkling of black pepper. Stewed fruits on the early palate, full and confident, with developing spices and brittle toffee. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with dark chocolate and soft oak. Price is per 1 liter.",80.0,91,46.0,1.0
643,John Hansell,"Soft, soothing, and gentle. Layered fruit (bright orchard fruit, honeyed melon, kiwi, pineapple), polished oak, and hay, subtly spiced with vanilla bean, milk chocolate, evergreen, and cotton candy. Bottled at peak maturity. Very more-ish, too! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",200.0,91,46.3,1.0
644,Gavin Smith,"The oldest bottling of Old Pulteney to date has been matured in American bourbon and Spanish sherry casks, and was personally bottled by distillery manager Malcolm Waring. The nose of this highly accomplished veteran is fragrant and waxy, with cooking apples, milk chocolate orange, Christmas spices, vanilla, and fudge. Initially, the substantial palate offers spicy fresh fruits, seasoned timber, then a hint of brine, with sultanas and plain chocolate. The finish is figgy, gingery, and sherried.  £1,490",2313.0,91,51.3,1.0
646,Gavin Smith,"Dalmore released 8,000 bottles of its latest 21 year old, initially matured 10 years in American oak barrels before an 11 year period of secondary maturation in first-fill Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzalez Byass. Intense aromas of Jaffa orange, marzipan, and ginger, plus soft oak. Robust, yet stylish. Smooth and well-rounded on the palate, with milky coffee, orange marmalade, cinnamon, and developing spicy dark chocolate. The lengthy finish is spicy, with licorice, a hint of citrus, and sweet oak.",530.0,91,42.0,1.0
647,Fred Minnick,"At 6 years old it’s hard to believe this could get any better with more time in the barrel. It begins with an explosion of honey, warm graham crackers, cinnamon, nutmeg, and marzipan. Then it’s saddle leather, pumice, caramel-covered popcorn, and jalapeño-and-peach jam spread over a flat tamale. More baking spices develop as the whiskey finishes long with a lovely salted-caramel note.",85.0,91,57.4,2.0
648,Gavin Smith,"Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series continues with this expression, finished for up to 6 months in ice wine casks sourced from Peller Estates winery in Ontario, Canada. Concentrated aromas of canned peaches in syrup, vanilla, and clotted cream. Silky on the palate, with a carryover of peaches from the nose and succulent blood oranges. The finish is medium in length, slowly drying, but fruity to the end. (7,800 bottles in U.S.)",250.0,91,43.0,1.0
649,Gavin Smith,"The first release from Ailsa Bay distillery is an NAS peated single malt. The new make spirit initially spends 6 to 9 months in 24 to 100-liter Hudson Baby Bourbon casks. It’s then transferred to virgin oak, first-fill, and refill American oak casks for several years. The ultimate vatting is non-chill filtered. A sweet, smoky nose with almonds and walnuts leads into a palate featuring citrus fruit, spicy peat, and cereal notes, with cocoa and soft oak in the finish. (UK and Nordic availability) £55",79.0,91,48.9,
651,John Hansell,"The most recent vintage from the 1980s. This whisky is very bright and lively. It dances on the palate with orange, tangerine, and lemon gum drops, balanced by vanilla, light caramel, hint of anise, and delicate oak. A whisky with great finesse and drinkability.",100.0,91,43.0,1.0
652,John Hansell,"Aged in a bourbon hogshead, allowing the distillery character to shine through. Fresh, lively and inviting (especially for its age), with a complex array of tropical and summer fruit, peppered with brine, vanilla, and a hint of baker’s chocolate. An oily texture adds weight. Dry, deliciously appetizing finish. An excellent aperitif whisky, but enjoyable anytime. (D & M Wines and Liquors exclusive.)",375.0,91,49.7,1.0
653,Gavin Smith,"This expression was distilled in December 1986 and filled into seven oloroso sherry butts. In 2012 the whisky was transferred to Pedro Ximénez butts for finishing. The nose yields sultanas, figs, old leather, and white pepper. Very sweet fruit notes on the palate, almost sugary, with background rich sherry, dates, and treacle. Long and warming in the finish, with a wisp of smoke and fruit spices. (4,200 bottles)",,91,44.6,1.0
654,Dave Broom,"The first thing I wrote was, “classic Kilchoman.” Then I paused…because it’s true. Though still young, here’s a distillery that has established its own character. In this expression you get full integration between oak and distillery, a sparkling mix of seashell and the freshness of seaweed, touched with churned butter, driftwood, and fresh-kilned peat. On the tongue, there’s samphire, peat, sweet barley, and an herbal kick. This is Kilchoman coming of age, assured and confident.",51.0,91,46.0,1.0
655,Gavin Smith,"This bottling is from the oldest cask owned by Tullibardine distillery, a sherry quarter cask (#341). An initial whiff of Cointreau on the nose, then vanilla develops, with marzipan, white pepper, linseed, and old hessian. Finally, musty sherry. A silky mouthfeel, with drier sherry, black currants, dark spices, and plain chocolate. Extraordinarily lingering, with orange wine gums and spicy licorice. Despite 50 years of maturation in a relatively small sherry cask, a whisky of great depth and quality has emerged. £16,000",23427.0,91,40.2,1.0
656,Gavin Smith,"Matured in a combination of oloroso sherry butts filled in 2008, and bourbon barrels filled in 2008 and 2009. The nose is initially flinty, with lemongrass, fabric Band-Aids, fudge, and vanilla. Ultimately the lemon is joined by Jaffa orange juice. Supple and sweet on the palate, with developing nutmeg and white pepper. Peppery in the finish, with plain chocolate and aromatic peat smoke. (840 bottles)",100.0,91,46.0,1.0
658,John Hansell,"Smooth, with gently layered sweet notes; nicely balanced. The least amount of oak and just a peppering of cinnamon and mint influence compared to the other four releases. It’s the most versatile of the four too.Not as complex as the “Rye 125”, but it makes up for this with its inviting drinkability and balance. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,91,45.0,2.0
660,John Hansell,"Significantly darker than the rest, well-balanced, and palate-coating. Softer, not as intense or as dry as the 30 year old. Creamier too, with subtle, yet exotic notes of tropical fruit and exotic spices. There is a point at which ultra-aged spirits -- whether they are whisky, rum, tequila, or brandy -- find a common ground. What they lose in identity, they gain in intrigue and layers of subtle complexity (if properly matured). This whisky fits into that category. Contemplative and ethereal in nature.",1000.0,91,42.9,1.0
661,John Hansell,"Complex and robust, with the biggest body of the group here. Very spicy (brisk clove, evergreen, warming cinnamon), but a solid sweet underbelly of toffee, caramel, and vanilla balances it. Its dry spicy finish makes a bold statement, without crossing the line. Very nice! Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,91,45.0,
662,John Hansell,"Very elegant and refined. Obviously this whisky was aged in a pristine sherry cask. The flavors are quite clean and well-defined. Gently sweet and fruity, with golden raisin, candy apple, and red raspberry jam. There’s delicate pineapple, dried cherry, coconut, and vanilla too, with a polished oak finish. A very classy Glenfiddich. Not as bold and spicy as last year’s 1976 vintage (which I had a hand in selecting but, ironically, don’t like as much). This new vintage approaches the caliber of the 1973 Vintage release from two years ago which I still think is the best one in recent years.",750.0,91,54.1,1.0
663,Gavin Smith,"This 23 year old expression was released for the Ardbeg Committee. It includes whisky matured in sherry and bourbon casks. Sweet asphalt, bonfire smoke, lemon sponge drizzled in iodine, and background cinnamon on the nose. Succulent, sherried, and chocolate-coated orchard fruits on the oily palate, with vanilla and sweet peat. The peat dries slowly in the finish, with developing licorice, kippers, and peppery oak",550.0,91,46.3,1.0
667,Fred Minnick,"If Picasso sketched bourbon, it would look like Booker’s, with deep golden and auburn hues. But higher-proof color can deceive. Not here. Think bourbon warehouse: oak, caramel, tobacco leaf, cinnamon, vanilla; floral with hints of honey and blueberry. And then it really comes alive. Oh, baby! Candy corn, crème brûlée, maple syrup, nutmeg, and traces of chipotle and cayenne. The proof strength doesn’t show. I recommend this batch neat for full, unrelenting flavor.",60.0,91,63.95,2.0
668,John Hansell,"A wheated recipe bourbon that was aged in experimental barrels with staves utilizing various methods of seasoning. Oak spice is important with a wheated bourbon, as there is no rye to balance the sweet notes, and this whiskey does a great job here. Delicate in personality, with nutty caramel, dried citrus, and golden raisin segueing to polished leather, warming cinnamon, clove, and hints of a cigar humidor.",70.0,91,50.0,
669,Fred Minnick,"Released in the spring of 2016. True balance and consistency from nose to finish, showing toffee, saltwater taffy, cinnamon Jolly Rancher, crème brûlée, nutmeg, toasted pecan, chocolate, fruit, delicate spice. Hints of pear, peach, and apple. I love the coffee and hazelnut on the long finish. I wonder if the taste would improve in the 107 to 111 proof range. As it is now, this is a must-have sipper.",120.0,91,47.2,2.0
670,Gavin Smith,"The first release from the new owners of Glenglassaugh distillery is obviously intended as a showpiece expression, and it does not disappoint. Due in the States next year. Damp moss and cedar on the early nose. Sultanas, candied orange, maraschino cherries, and sherry. Treacle notes in time. Spicy fruits, figs, brittle toffee, sherry, and ginger on the mellow yet robust palate. The finish is medium in length, with allspice and old oak, plus a wisp of tarry smoke. £245",395.0,91,44.8,1.0
672,Fred Minnick,"Think the holidays: nutmeg, butterscotch, cinnamon, gingerbread cookies, and saltwater taffy. Mouth-coating sensations down the jawline and palate roof. Caramel and vanilla follow it home to the finish, where out-of-nowhere black currant and blackberry jam linger to the very end. This is a fun sipper for those who love the barrel-finished style. (375 ml.)",50.0,91,45.2,2.0
673,Fred Minnick,"This straight bourbon is a race of notes trying to outrun each other. Out of the gate, it’s caramel and vanilla, with a bevy of fruit, soft florals, and chocolate slightly trailing. Oak and smoke take the lead on the first turn, then an explosion of butterscotch and Spanish flan setting the pace. Then graham crackers, marshmallow, and melted chocolate eye the prize, with rich, rounded caramel custard taking the long route to the finish line. Definite contender!",110.0,91,55.0,2.0
675,Fred Minnick,"The perfect proof. Rich in color, aroma, and flavor. It begins with powerful caramel, baking spice, chocolate, cherries, cinnamon, and toffee. Then nuance and complexity. Honey, jalapeño, rosemary, crème brûlée, malt, and fruit, from the spicy citrus of grapefruit to prunes and dried apricots. Hard to believe this is over 100 proof, as you never sense the strength challenging you to find what’s next amidst the subtlety. Extremely long finish with cherry, cinnamon, and caramel. Value Pick.",60.0,91,57.5,2.0
676,Fred Minnick,"Cotton candy, oak, leather, tobacco, and clove open this unique whiskey. Then, strong aromas of earth—trees, dirt, mushrooms, and pine—are followed by quick blasts of baking spices, plum pudding, yams, and malt. These notes coalesce into chocolate, coconut, and caramel. For a long finish, both pepper and baking spices rest on the palate. Lovely fireplace sipper.",100.0,91,53.8,2.0
677,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A few years ago, Alberta’s Highwood distillers purchased all the remaining stock from Potter’s whisky brokerage just over the Rocky Mountains in Kelowna. With it, Highwood skillfully created a sumptuous, limited-edition bottling that is as sweet, smooth, and creamy as French vanilla ice cream, and richer in fresh clean wood than a carpentry shop. Dried cloves and red cedar balance real maple syrup and butterscotch which, in turn, dissolve into sweet white grapefruit. (Alberta only) C$52",52.0,91,40.0,4.0
680,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Winemakers have long known that toasted oak is very spicy. Today’s whisky makers are slowly catching on. Cinnamon hearts and hot peppermint add zing to a rich and creamy mouthfeel. Although the whisky is not overly sweet, it has a candied feel. Cloves and hot pepper round out the spices while vanilla and butterscotch lend smoothness as they keep earthy, flinty rye notes under control. Essences of cedar cigar box and black, withered figs contribute additional complexity. C$50",50.0,91,45.0,4.0
681,Lew Bryson,"Cask-strength rye made from Arkansas-grown grain, aged 26 months. Must be a small barrel; it’s quite dark. Nose of crushed rye grain, well-polished oak furniture, and moist rye bread. Swift and certain in the mouth: dense, chewy flavors of rye bread, sweet and full and bitter, crackling with oak spice, and drawing to a sizzling finish. I do like a small distiller whiskey that knows where it’s going. Very impressive.",60.0,91,57.9,3.0
682,Lew Bryson,"Old school spicy nose, almost archetypal scents of sweet teaberry, cinnamon, and spearmint hard candy, with a firm, warm alcohol backing. True in the mouth: I’m tasting just what I smelled, all on a full bed of corn sweetness, floating off into a warm finish. Could it be more complex? Yes, but it’s beautifully balanced, and not the over-oaked shellac that passes for mature bourbon these days. If this was under $30 a bottle, I’d marry it. (6,000 bottles)",75.0,91,46.5,2.0
683,Dave Broom,"Sweet and sherried, with plenty of sugar and toffee, moving into plums and thick chestnut honey. Give it time, however, and a haunting note of dried mango and guava emerges, followed by amontillado-style nuttiness and then beeswax polish. All in all, just what you want from a gently-aged BenRiach. The palate may seem initially grippy, but there’s such a massing of fruits that it copes well. Keep neat for maximum impact. Superb. £180",283.0,91,48.8,1.0
684,John Hansell,"The fifth release in Diageo’s Orphan Barrel series (and the youngest of the releases so far). Distilled at the “new” Bernheim distillery and, once again, matured most recently in Stitzel-Weller warehouses. Complex flavors are well-integrated, with lovely spice notes (cinnamon, vanilla, mint, nutmeg), nougat, caramel, and subtle fruit. Long, satisfying finish. Not as distinctive as some previous Orphan Barrel releases, but more rounded and balanced. Nicely done!",65.0,91,45.25,2.0
686,John Hansell,"Big and spicy, but contrasted by layers of sweetness. Vibrant dried spice (warming cinnamon, crisp mint, nutmeg, and cigar box), caramel, nougat, black raspberry, dried citrus, and a hint of chocolate fudge laced with coconut. Very warming on the finish, with a nice resinous grip without being over-oaked. A very dynamic whiskey.",50.0,91,47.5,2.0
687,John Hansell,"Drier, less toffee and fruit, more dried spice and oak when compared to the standard Oban 14 year old.  A beautiful combination of rich, nutty toffee balanced by polished oak, salt, pepper, seaweed, distant smoke, and dried fruit.  Somewhat oily in texture.  Wonderful depth, too!  An improvement on what is already the biggest-selling Diageo single malt scotch in the U.S.  Very exciting and dynamic.  (7,700 bottles available only in the U.S. and at the Oban distillery).",150.0,91,43.0,1.0
689,John Hansell,"I feel this is by far the best whisky in the standard Auchentoshan portfolio, and it is one of the best Auchentoshans ever released. It’s delicious, nicely balanced, and with lovely depth for a Lowland whisky. Baked muffins, creamy vanilla, honey, and caramel blend nicely with delicate fruit notes (lemon, red current, strawberries). An impeccably balanced whisky. Similar to the 10 year old reviewed below, but with greater depth and a drier finish.",115.0,91,43.0,1.0
691,John Hansell,"A delicious base of creamy vanilla and rich caramel, complemented by tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple, ripe mango), golden raisin, and raspberry preserve, and jazzed up with spice (cocoa, cinnamon, nutmeg). Polished oak on the finish. The flavors are nicely integrated. My favorite of the last several annual releases.",55.0,91,49.0,2.0
692,Dave Broom,"Another first fill sherry butt, giving its typical reddish-brown hue. This runs more into the clove, cassia, and allspice area than just dried fruit. While maturity is obvious, and there’s even a hint of dunnage/leatheriness, it is the concentrated fruit sweetness that surprises here. The distillery has fought back against the cask, and while still crepuscular in nature, there is a rich, concentrated, and mellow glow at its heart. £345",530.0,91,57.1,1.0
693,Lew Bryson,"Rich and sweet on the nose: crème brûlée, unfinished oak furniture, circus peanuts, overripe warm melon. Corn puffs and sweet cornbread, vanilla cream, oak density, firm heat, and an affably full mouthfeel that doesn’t thin till the very end. Easily one of the best Jack Daniel’s whiskeys I’ve ever had, but the price is jaw-dropping even today (the package does include a previously-unreleased 1966 concert recording of Old Blue Eyes). Price is per 1 liter.",500.0,91,50.0,
696,John Hansell,"Quite lively for 25 years, with layers of bright fruit (lemon, nectarine, grapefruit, pineapple) on a bed of vanilla and honey. There’s a peppering of dried spice, smoldering ember, and beach pebbles. Lightly smoky, dried spice finish. Very nice. Brora enthusiasts will not be disappointed, but the prices of the whisky from this shuttered distillery are creeping up.",350.0,91,56.3,1.0
697,Jonny McCormick,"There is a beautiful interplay between the lemon and sharp lime set against the bracing coastal nature of this dram. Gentle vanilla, honey, lemon zest, and gooseberry compote waft from the glass. Vanilla frosting, coconut macaroon bars, malt drinks, peach, lemon, and an undercurrent of pepper. Creamy chocolate once the spice subsides, it ends with a fantastically chewy mouthfeel. Nuts, pepper, and cocoa make for a mouth-coating finish.",111.0,91,47.4,1.0
698,Gavin Smith,"Staff members at Dalmore selected this distillery-exclusive bottling, which has been drawn from American white oak cask number 446, and bottled at cask strength. The out-turn comprises 450 bottles. Refined, polished oak on the nose. Honey, marzipan, caramel, and vanilla. Fragrant, with old leather and over-ripe oranges when water is added. Warm leather, apricots, orange marmalade, cocoa powder, and developing spice on the palate. A long, spicy, citric finish. Finally, licorice. £150",236.0,91,59.0,1.0
699,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Inspired by Crown Royal Monarch, Crown Royal is introducing a new line of equally remarkable whiskies called the Noble Collection. This “Cornerstone Blend” begins the series. Rye-grain whisky, fresh-cut lumber, and new oak. Sweet, with a broad spiciness, rich heady nose, floral overtones, and fruity esters. Vague milk chocolate, tropical fruit, and ripe bananas soften the peppery spices. Powerful yet elegant. Complex and tightly synthesized into a single, well balanced whole.",60.0,91,40.3,4.0
700,John Hansell,"Deep amber color. Wonderfully complex, and nicely balanced aroma and flavor of vanilla sweetness, tarry rope, oak, toffee, seaweed, and brine. Medium to full in body, and creamy in texture, with a finish that doesn't quit.",225.0,91,43.0,1.0
701,John Hansell,"The whisky begins sweet and creamy, with notes of vanilla, honey, and ripe malt (reminiscent of a malting floor). Then the Laphroaig signature peat smoke, seaweed, tar, and medicinal notes emerge. Bottling at 48% and without chill-filtering keeps the whisky from being dulled down. A whisky that is very dynamic. Nicely done.",50.0,91,48.0,1.0
702,John Hansell,"Darker in both flavor and personality when compared to its sibling. Rich palate-coating caramel and toffee provide the foundation for roasted nuts, dark berry fruit, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and polished leather. Long, satisfying finish. Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection French Oak Barrel Aged Bourbons 2015 Release. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,91,45.0,2.0
705,Dave Broom,"Dark mahogany with ruby glints and a green rim. Lots of highly-polished oak as we move out of the woods and into a silent country estate. Wax polish and masses of whisky rancio. Sherry-soaked oak, dry leaves, currants, and ripe blackberry. Highly concentrated, but the fruits push their way through only lightly-resisting tannins. There’s a hint of smoke and Seville orange bitterness on the finish. My pick of the quartet. Excellent. 285 bottles.",,91,56.6,1.0
706,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Finished in wet, freshly dumped bourbon barrels, Double Barrel shows strong bourbonesque vanilla and a slippery, almost syrupy lushness. This latest batch is even creamier than the early ones made by John Hall himself. After a deceptively simple start, a mouth-filling toffee sweetness broadens into ripe tropical fruits with fleeting under-notes reminiscent of earthy dragonfruit. Hot, peppery flares punctuate the soft fruitiness as it moves to the fore and the creamy mouthfeel subsides.",47.0,91,40.0,
707,John Hansell,"Distilled in 2002. For many years now, this wheated whiskey has maintained just the right amount of oak influence for balance and added complexity. This year’s release is sporting some extra dried oak spice (especially on the finish), but it’s still a delicious whiskey. Notes of toffee, maple syrup, blackberry jam, cinnamon, and vanilla, with a dry, allspice and polished leather finish.",80.0,91,70.1,
708,John Hansell,"Often ignored because it’s not barrel proof like the other bourbons in the collection. The past couple years have shown a gradual increase in oak spice and resin. This year’s offering particularly sports unnecessary oak, showing more leather, dried spice (especially cinnamon), barrel char and tannins than needed to marry with the toffee, caramel, rum, mocha, dried fruit, and tobacco notes. Still very enjoyable, but slightly past its prime.",80.0,91,45.0,2.0
710,John Hansell,"There was an Aberlour 18 on the market for a spell several years ago, aged in sherry casks, that I really enjoyed. Now we have this new 18 year old expression. There are big shoes to fill, and this whisky fills them quite nicely. Once again, the sherry is prominent throughout, with its lush fruit, velvety texture, and sweet demeanor. But it’s not cloying or sappy — the sherry blends in nicely with the rest of the flavors. Ripe orange, apricot preserve, peach cobbler, chocolate-covered caramel, and toffee, with a sprinkling of cinnamon and cocoa. Rich, silky smooth, satisfying finish. Very impressive. The Aberlour 18 year old’s reputation remains intact!",100.0,91,43.0,1.0
712,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Three Grain Harmony marries rye and barley whiskies from 1992-94 to 4 year old corn whisky. The corn lends voluptuous body to a complex assortment of carefully integrated grains, dark fruits, prune juice, and butterscotch. Dried herbs, potpourri, and orange peel follow as the palate begins to broaden. When the big notes fade, look for delicate subtleties. Hot spices and pepper build from sip to sip and linger long into the sandalwood finish.",70.0,91,43.0,4.0
715,John Hansell,"Heaven Hill’s first wood-finished bourbon. Finished for several months in cognac casks (reminiscent of Beam’s Distillers’ Masterpiece offering around a decade ago), which show nicely without dominating. Very silky and smooth in texture. Notes of graham cracker, dark fleshy fruit (ripe grape, blackberry brandy), light toffee, maple syrup on pancakes, and creamy vanilla. Great balance, distinctive, and perilously drinkable for 100 proof.",80.0,91,50.0,2.0
716,Gavin Smith,"Matured in oloroso sherry casks. Confident plum, prune, and raisin notes on the early nose, with developing ripe cherries, sherried fudge, and resin. A slightly earthy undertone. Viscous in the mouth—very sweet—with developing tingling spices, then darker fruit notes emerge, with licorice and plain chocolate. The finish is long, with enduring dark chocolate and fruity spice. (1,180 bottles)",850.0,91,50.6,1.0
717,Gavin Smith,"This 39 year old was matured in a single refill American hogshead. Orange Jujubes on the early nose, with vanilla, honey, and linseed. Big, sweet, soft fruit notes on the palate, with pipe tobacco and a hint of background peat smoke. Aniseed and ginger develop, along with the merest hint of old oak in the persistently fruity finish. £1,250; Not available in the U.S. (225 bottles)",,91,56.0,1.0
718,Gavin Smith,"Initially filled into an ex-bourbon cask, then transferred into a Gonzales Byass oloroso ‘Matusalem’ sherry butt in 2005 for four years, before a final two years in a freshly-emptied bourbon barrel. The nose is initially floral, with overripe Seville oranges, figs, ginger, and cocoa powder. Peaches and almonds on the palate, before dark fruits and salted nuts appear. Drying oak is held at bay, and the final note is fat and figgy. Cask number 14; 233 bottles.",,91,45.5,1.0
720,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Although this whisky was distilled at CC’s sister plant in Alberta, the dried dark fruit signature of Canadian Club is evident as soon as you open the cap. Elegant, but never subdued; cloves, nutmeg, and allspice play off the fruit and underlying notes of clean grain dust. Vanilla and rich woody tones indicate at least some virgin oak barrels were used for its 7 year maturation. Rich caramels soften a gently glowing heat. Complex and beautifully balanced. (Canada only) Value Pick.",27.0,91,40.0,
721,Dave Broom,"A welcome return for Hart Brothers. This Glen Grant is light, clean, and penetrating, with lots of gooseberry, melon, basil, and cut grass. This turns into an intriguing note of concentrated fruits; think yellow wine gums and fresh William pear. The palate has classic Glen Grant purity, with a hint of tropical fruits. Water adds another graceful layer on top, making the effect more like a rose garden…one which you keep returning to. Excellent. £66",103.0,91,51.1,1.0
723,Gavin Smith,"This is the ultimate PortWood expression from Balvenie and has been finished in 30 year old port pipes. A more vibrant and textured Travel Retail variant is non-chill filtered and bottled at 47.6%. Soft, red grape notes, vanilla, and milk chocolate on the nutty nose. Very discreet smoke. Rich plum flavors in the mouth, dark berries covered in cream, and spicy honey. The finish is long and elegantly drying.",220.0,91,40.0,1.0
725,Gavin Smith,"The oldest house bottling of Longmorn to date is non-chill filtered and lavishly presented in a purple casket, which probably accounts for a chunk of the purchase price. The nose is classic Longmorn: soft and sweet, majoring in honey, hazelnuts, caramel, and milk chocolate, while the creamy palate features orchard fruits, ginger, and allspice. The finish is lengthy and softly spiced, with honey, orange, and sweet oak.",1450.0,91,48.0,1.0
727,John Hansell,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas of rich sherry, ripe fruit, toffee, molasses, peat smoke, damp oak, and nuts. Medium to full in body. Its flavors start out rich and sweet, with sherried fruit, toffee, and dark chocolate. It then becomes drier with notes of peat, smoked nuts, seaweed and brine, ultimately finishing with notes of spice, bitter chocolate, and smoky smoldering embers. 
   Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: approx. $160. Available at specialty retailers nationwide. 
   This is a new bottling of Bowmore 25 year old and an improved one at that. It is richer, fuller, and more balanced than its predecessor. A wonderful dram indeed. The 17 year old was my favorite of the standard Bowmore line. Not anymore.",160.0,91,43.0,1.0
728,Dave Broom,"Pale and slightly flinty to start, with touches of Caol lla-style salt-washed rocks, but here there’s sweetness, while the smoke gives it a mezcal-like air; pears and burning wood (hot brake pads), minerality, then green olive and a light medicinal note. With water, sashimi-style cleanliness. The palate is rounded, with real olive oil, peppery sweetness, soot, and white chocolate. A real ‘palate whisky,’ filled with bare-faced bravado.  A great Ardbeg.",160.0,91,55.0,1.0
729,John Hansell,"This replaces the 17 year old in the standard Bowmore portfolio. (The 17 year old will now be Duty Free Only.) The difference is significant. This one is more sherried than the 17 year old, and it wears the sherry well. I know that many of you, like myself, adore the 17 year old. Indeed, I feel that the 17 year old displays the true essence of Bowmore. But this 18 year old integrates the sherry notes with the Bowmore signature to create a richly flavored Islay whisky experience. Thick toffee, ripe fruit, and tar-tinged smoke are accentuated by dark chocolate, cocoa powder, burnt raisin, dates, and sea salt. Long, entertaining finish.",85.0,91,43.0,1.0
730,John Hansell,"A very clean, elegant Bowmore with a naked beauty that shows its Islay roots. You’ll find fresh brine and seaweed on a bed of honeyed malt and soft vanilla cream. Subtle berries, citrus, and melon fruit add a complex fruit dimension. Fresh, appetizing finish. Nicely done! (Exclusive to The Party Source.)",100.0,91,58.9,1.0
733,Dominic Roskrow,"There’s something enigmatic and highly attractive about this distillery and its deceased brother, Brora. Perhaps it’s the unpredictability; there are plenty of independent releases of varied and often questionable quality, and you’re never quite sure what’s going to turn up. Even iconic expressions such as the 30 year olds can vary from quite sublime to appalling and sulfury when in the wrong hands.
When the malts from both distilleries are good, though — and the official bottlings tend to be — they’re very, very good. This Clynelish is a delightful surprise from the beginning, its nose some way removed from the official 14 year old, and more in common with some recent Diageo-release Broras, mixing soft maritime notes with squiggly peat and some fruit notes. The palate is complex and attractive, with savory peat, sweet pineapple, salt, light fish, drizzled lemon, pepper, chili, and cardamom. It all makes for a big, complex, evolving (and grown up) whisky — and great value for the price tag.",96.0,91,57.3,1.0
734,Dominic Roskrow,"You want and expect rich and peaty malt from Lagavulin and you get it here in droves, though not in the most obvious way. This version is somewhere between the cask strength 12 year old and the Distiller’s Edition, rather than the standard 16 year old, but it’s an absolute peach and a treat for lovers of this distillery. The nose is constrained and shy at first, with lychee and kiwi fruit offering a sweet and gentle carpet to coastal peaty notes. The palate is big, rich, full, and peppered, with sharp apple and citrus fruits. It benefits from water, too, as there’s a delightful swell of fruit, chili, peat, and soft licorice. As with all great Lagavulins, the tarry peatiness lingers longest in the finish.",112.0,91,52.5,1.0
735,Gavin Smith,"Non-chill filtered and matured exclusively in bourbon casks. Very floral on the nose, with toffee and spicy new leather. Soft and slightly smoky in the mouth, with vanilla and spicy, ripe pears.  A touch of licorice leads into a long, slightly drying finish. (670 bottles)",615.0,91,41.0,1.0
736,John Hansell,"A new line of Islay single malts from Specialty Drinks, an extension of The Whisky Exchange. (The bottle doesn’t tell you which distillery this whisky came from, but if you look at a map of Islay you can probably figure it out.) I like this expression better than the more expensive 25 year old. There’s impeccable balance and more vibrancy in this 17 year old, with seaweed, smoked Spanish olive, coal soot, pencil shavings, citrus, and anise, along with subtle kipper and picked ginger. All this is layered on a bed of oily, honeyed malt. Salty, peppery, sooty, tarry finish. Nicely done! £50",81.0,91,45.8,1.0
737,Gavin Smith,"Nutty on the nose, with a whiff of new leather and tropical fruit, plus the aroma of unsmoked cigars. Complex on the full palate, with almonds, citrus fruit, ginger, plain chocolate, a slight herbal note, and sweet oak. The finish is long and spicy, with black pepper and increasing oak. An often underrated single malt at its very best. (1,600 bottles)",500.0,91,46.0,1.0
738,John Hansell,"The 8th Private Edition release. This one is finished in sun-baked casks which previously contained Malmsey Madeira. A predominantly sweet and fruity whisky, with caramel, honeyed almonds, peaches in syrup, and orange scone. Soft, soothing finish. Delicious!",100.0,91,46.0,1.0
739,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Vague fruitiness, barrel notes, and corncobs on the nose turn to lush caramels, with a plush mouthfeel punctuated by hints of rye spices that become more assertive as notes of cloves meld into candy cane on a long, spicy, then pithy finish. There is more fruit in this special Canada 150 edition of Confederation Oak—sweet ripe apples and tart gooseberries. A masterful example of blending.",70.0,91,40.0,4.0
740,Dave Broom,"A vatting of three first-fill American oak casks, for me this is the most lifted and effusive of the ongoing Cellar Collection range. The nose is full of aromas of anise, blackcurrant leaf, honeysuckle, jasmine, frangipani flowers, and a subtle almond sweetness. The palate continues in similar vein with more spice and just sufficient oak to add distinct structure and a coconut character. Sublime. It won’t, however, be released in the U.S. £1,000",,91,43.3,1.0
741,Lew Bryson,"Vanilla and oak nose, with a creamy layer of mint that warns you: Rye Ahead. And what a sweet rye wave it is, rolling in with green mint and grass, more bourbony oak and vanilla, lively spice on the top (with enough heat to keep it bold), and a finish that brings everything together. Beautifully integrated, and not overly woody, a tribute to the blending art of Canadian distillers.",130.0,91,40.0,4.0
745,John Hansell,"Surprisingly fresh - sanguine even - for its age, and appetizingly aromatic. Fairly light and approachable in body, but always inspiring and pithy. Notes of fresh, seabreeze brine, teasing exotic spices, and tangerine are softened by gently creamy malt notes and hints of coconut and almond. Very delicious and enjoyable anytime.",200.0,91,43.0,1.0
746,John Hansell,"Bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered. Smart move! It really helps this whisky. This is a soft — almost elegant — Laphroaig (if that’s not an oxymoron). Very clean, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, brine, seaweed, and peat smoke, with just a teasing of the medicinal, band-aid notes that Laphroaig is known for. The owner-bottled 18 year old, which I rated a 90, is darker and drier, with more oak on the finish. I like this Hart Brothers expression just a little better.",135.0,91,46.0,1.0
748,John Hansell,"A single cask from the distillery’s peated “Port Charlotte” line of whiskies. Well behaved for such youth. Nice honeyed malt and soft caramel base with good viscosity as a bed for tarry peat, licorice stick, freshly-ground pepper, and cocoa, along with a kiss of sauternes, delicate pit fruit, smoked seaweed, and a lingering coastal accent. Long, warming finish. (Park Avenue Liquor exclusive)",120.0,90,63.4,1.0
750,John Hansell,"Very smooth for Laphroaig -- the extra aging has mellowed this whisky. Soothing honeyed malt, creamy vanilla, and toffee provide a bed for peat smoke, charcoal, and tar; along with more subtle brine, smoked seaweed, anise, ginger, and citrus. A gentler, creamier, more tactile, less medicinal Laphroaig when compared to some of its siblings. Will you prefer the new 18 year old to the 15 year old it is replacing? That depends. I enjoy the balance and subtle complexity of flavors with the 15 year old, but I also like the enhanced richness and mouth-coating creaminess of the 18. The higher strength (and no chill-filtering) of the 18 is certainly a bonus. (Side note: I know this is a moot point now, but I would like to have seen the 15 year old bottled at 48%, rather than 43%.)",90.0,90,48.0,1.0
752,Gavin Smith,"Matured in a mixture of oloroso sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks. Honey, vanilla, and tropical fruits on the spicy, aromatic nose, with just a hint of oak. The honey and vanilla carry over to the palate, where they are joined by peaches, drinking chocolate, and subtle sherry. The finish dries steadily, with long-lasting citrus fruit. A stylish, complex dram.",550.0,90,46.8,
753,John Hansell,"There have been a lot of old, heavily sherried, independently bottled Glen Grant whiskies on the market over the past several years. This one appears to be from a refill sherry cask, as its influence is more subtle. It has aged well, showing no excessive oak, but plenty of fruit (summer fruits, dried citrus, stewed fruits, tangerine, golden raisin), balanced by polished oak, grape skin, and subtle dark chocolate. Distinctively pleasing. Don’t add too much water, though, as it breaks down. (A Kensington Wine Market exclusive.) $500 (CAD)",512.0,90,49.4,1.0
754,Gavin Smith,"The third release in Macallan’s annual Edition series—which focuses on aspects of cask influence—was matured in a mix of European and American oak casks. Figs and apricot jam, vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and cinnamon on the nose. The palate is silky and offers a big citrus fruit hit, Bit-O-Honey, then creamy milk chocolate. Milk chocolate persists through the long, fruity finish, with attendant sweet oak.",95.0,90,48.3,1.0
755,John Hansell,"These Port Ellen whiskies are becoming increasingly rare since the distillery closed down for good in 1983. This is a very good example of an old-fashioned Islay whisky: never heavy, but with lots of kick. There’s plenty of wet leaf, bonfire smoke, coal tar, and some earthy, damp kiln notes and brine. But you’ll discover a lovely honeyed maltiness for balance, along with tangerine, dirty martini, and cocoa for complexity. Smoky, briny finish. There will be a time when some of us will tell the next generation of whisky drinkers about the joys of Port Ellen. Mare sure you’re one of those telling the story, not listening to it. (Exclusive to Kensington Wine Market.) $250 (Canadian)",256.0,90,54.7,1.0
757,John Hansell,"The seventh limited edition release of Port Ellen whiskies by Diageo. Not as vibrant and intense as younger bottlings (particularly on the nose), but nicely matured with a satisfying sweet foundation. Notes of toffee and roasted nuts permeate though the peat kiln smoke, coal tar, fish nets, and charred oak. Seaweed and brine, more reserved mid-palate, emerges noticeably on the finish. The Port Ellen bottlings are getting older (the distillery closed in 1983) and they are getting more expensive. This one still captures the essence of Port Ellen.",300.0,90,53.8,1.0
758,Dave Broom,"So soon? This latest release of what is becoming a legendary series mixes nine casks—four butts, five hoggies—from between 1966 and 1990. Hugely complex and obviously mature, it is one to sit and smell forever. Marzipan, mocha, pain au chocolat, manuka honey; every sniff reveals another aroma. It opens into cigar, sandalwood, citrus, and ripe black fruits. The palate is equally layered and expansive. It takes water, but only a drop, for that density is all-important.",250.0,90,50.1,1.0
759,Fred Minnick,"There’s a certain complexity here that you just come to expect in limited edition Four Roses. This one doesn’t disappoint. Rose petals, honeysuckle, caramel, roasted pine nuts, cotton candy, dark coffee, and vanilla. The creamy mouthfeel delightfully brings in warm cinnamon roll, chocolate truffle, and honey taffy, balanced by herbs and subtle earthiness that settle with a long-lasting cinnamon-forward finish.",125.0,90,58.4,2.0
760,Fred Minnick,"Delightful opening of fruit, praline, caramel, maraschino cherries, and spice, with a burst of smoked paprika and a hint of leather. It’s soft on the palate, easily gliding down the jawline, filling with flavors of caramel chew, saltwater taffy, coffee, and a rich, toasted pumpernickel rye with just a sprinkle of cinnamon. Based on the taste, I’d think this flavorful beauty would offer a long finish, but misses the mark. Thankfully, spice over the medium finish is quite pleasant.",110.0,90,45.2,2.0
761,Dave Broom,"You would expect any 70 year old whisky to be crepuscular, dense, and wooded. Not here. The nose is amazingly fresh — distillery character fully intact — with layers of rancio and heavy florals. In time, there’s candle wax, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a touch of leather, even the whiff of a soft mink stole. Concentrated and complex. The palate is like an ancient vin santo with oxidized nuttiness, quince and medlar, and subtle peat. Hugely expressive on the palate, with a sweet finish. Truly remarkable.",,90,45.9,1.0
764,Gavin Smith,"This veteran expression was fully matured in first-fill sherry butts. Fragrant on the nose, with black treacle, prunes, raisins, lanolin, bung cloths, and polished oak. Big stewed fruit and warm leather notes on the palate, soon reeled in by spicy tannic oak, plus licorice and aniseed, though a stubborn dusty fruitiness persists. The finish is lengthy and mouth-drying, with lots of dark oak. A lovely example of its kind. £1,575",2020.0,90,40.0,1.0
765,John Hansell,"A limited run to commemorate Elmer’s birthday. An elegant, complex whiskey. The flavors are nice and tight. Bright fruit (dried citrus, tangerine, nectarine, hint of pineapple), brittle mint, vanilla, and gin botanicals, soothed by nougat and soft caramel, with subtle -- yet lingering -- dark chocolate, espresso, and dried tobacco on the finish. Great drinkability too!",30.0,90,45.0,2.0
768,Gavin Smith,"Matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks, this is 20% peated whisky from 1997 and 80% fruitier whisky distilled in 2001. Earthy on the early nose, with bonfire smoke, vanilla, raisins, and prunes. The palate opens with sweet fruit notes and medium-dry sherry, giving way to nutmeg, brine, and peat. The finish features plain chocolate, bitter lemons, and a hint of smoky chili. £85",109.0,90,45.8,1.0
769,Fred Minnick,"Rich and rounded vanilla, baking spices, caramel, and cast iron-baked cornbread straight from the oven. Hints of smoke, dried apricot, fresh-cut grass, and tilled earth. Then, raw honey, marzipan, raisins, and sweet oats, followed by baking spices for a medium to long finish. It’s very nice and needs no dilution to open up. Think of this as a high-proof sipper.",90.0,90,58.5,2.0
770,John Hansell,"Older expressions of this unpeated Islay dram are often quite delicious, but they aren't easy to come by. The best ones, like this one, take the sweetish toffee/nutty foundation of younger expressions and add layers of depth and complexity. This whisky just continues to evolve on the palate. The entrance is creamy in texture with layers of sweetness (caramel, vanilla fudge, toffee), becoming nutty and marzipan-like with subtle background fruit. The finish is long and pleasingly dry, with a hint of salt. Very entertaining and satisfying.",160.0,90,40.2,1.0
771,Fred Minnick,"Gorgeous dried apricot, peach cobbler, vanilla custard, plus a hint of cherry-flavored pipe tobacco. Rich, layered, and rounded caramel, with hints of cinnamon, nutmeg, clove, and allspice. Then earth, and lots of it, over a slightly chewy mouthfeel of caramel chew and Red Hots cinnamon candy. Medium finish counters wonderful bouquet and palate notes, but still lovely for sipping.",600.0,90,57.1,2.0
772,John Hansell,"Nougat and dates to the fore, then becoming increasingly nutty with suggestions of Demerara rum and cinnamon and underlying polished leather. Lovely dried spice notes and an appetizing salty tang teases the palate on the finish.",265.0,90,43.0,1.0
773,Gavin Smith,"Highland Park 12 Year Old boasts individuality and complexity, thanks in part to the use of Orcadian peat in the distillery floor maltings and the employment of ex-sherry casks for maturation. The nose is fragrant and floral, with hints of heather and some spice. Smooth and honeyed on the palate, with citrus fruits, malt, and distinctive tones of wood smoke in the warm, lengthy, slightly peaty finish.",46.0,90,40.0,1.0
774,John Hansell,"Very fragrant on the nose, and thick on the palate. The flavors are chock full of thick chewy toffee, chocolate fudge, roasted nuts, burnt raisin, black currant, and spiced oak. There’s a hint of salt and Earl Grey tea on the finish. Very dynamic.",200.0,90,54.4,1.0
777,Dave Broom,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. A first-fill American oak hoggie was the receptacle for the representative from the 1960s. The cask has provided an extremely relaxed environment for maturation to take place, with a return of the pineapple (grilled on a barbecue this time), along with linden blossom, cream, green jasmine tea, and mint. The effect is like a grown up 1991. The maturity kicks in on the palate — thick and slow with some sandalwood alongside honeysuckle. Gentle and clean, and again not one to dilute. £750",,90,40.6,1.0
778,John Hansell,"Light bronze color. Thick, mature aromas, with notes of subtle spice (vanilla, mint), toffee, light molasses and leather. Adding a little water revealing notes of teaberry, anise, and dark candied fruit. Pleasantly sweet at first in flavor, with notes of brown sugar and spice (vanilla, mint), becoming dry with enveloping flavors of oak and leather. With a little water, more subtle flavors are revealed, including toffee, dark fruit, and anise. The whisky finishes long and dry with significant depth. This is a big exciting bourbon, full of character from the distillery previously known as Ancient Age. The price is right too-if you can find the whiskey to buy it.",25.0,90,45.0,2.0
781,Fred Minnick,"Tennessee whiskey shall not be undersold in this flavorful version. Rich notes of caramel and vanilla developing in yellow cake batter with dark caramel, brown sugar, leather, toasted pecans, and hints of walnut, smoked apple, and honey. Then red fruit, baking spice, and complex butterscotch over a palate-coating mouthfeel that’s perfectly warm and balanced all over. As good as it is, it could be better with ten more proof points. Its light proof shows in a shorter-than-desired finish. (Tennessee only) 375ml",75.0,90,43.5,2.0
782,Gavin Smith,"Released with no age statement, Fettercairn Fior contains 15 percent heavily-peated whisky matured in first-fill ex-bourbon barrels, along with a proportion of 14 and 15 year old spirit.

784,Gavin Smith,"This latest vintage release from Glen Garioch is a cask strength 25 year old. It follows on from previous ‘small-batch’ 1978, 1990, 1991, and 1994 vintages. Peaches and ginger on the nose, with fudge and a wisp of smoke. Mildly herbal. Full-bodied, rich, and sweet in the mouth. Fresh fruit and violet creams. Finally a slightly earthy, peaty note. The finish is long and gently smoky. Robust, yet refined.",185.0,90,54.6,1.0
785,Dave Broom,"Created by Dennis Malcolm to celebrate his half century at Glen Grant, this uses casks
from each of his five decades. Pale it may be, but this is no dainty little
thing. There’s lots of buttery oak before classic Glen Grant lift and energy
emerge: green apple, fruit blossom, William pear, and yellow fruits; lemon
butter icing and nettles with water. The palate is vibrant and energetic, but
holds to the middle of the tongue. A suitably celebratory dram.
Congratulations! £115",177.0,90,46.0,1.0
787,John Hansell,"A remarkably balanced bourbon. Evolving notes of maple, vanilla, mint, dried fruit, coconut, and polished oak with a hint of leather on the finish.

789,John Hansell,"One of the leading bourbon-specialty bars in the U.S., located in Chicago, finally has its own single barrel bourbon. The flavors are nicely balanced, and there’s a soothing, creamy texture throughout the palate. Sweet notes of coconut cream, vanilla fudge, and honeycomb are enhanced by a complex array of more delicate notes of spearmint, green tea, golden raisin, dusty corn, cocoa, and oak resin. This time, “13” is a lucky number.",75.0,90,50.0,2.0
790,Gavin Smith,"The Dalmore spirit that comprises Ceti comes from a mix of bourbon and sherry casks, with bourbon wood predominating. 23 years of maturation in American oak were followed by seven years in 30 year old Gonzalez Byass Matusalem oloroso sherry butts. The result is a nose of old leather, hessian, sandalwood, vanilla, plain chocolate, and ripe Jaffa oranges. Very full-bodied, with burnt orange, pineapple, and sticky toffee, while the finish offers ginger, orange wine gums, and old oak. 1,000 bottles. £1,250",,90,45.0,1.0
791,John Hansell,"Stagg is so smooth, it’s quite drinkable at higher proofs. On the other hand, when you bring it down to the strength that you would normally drink your whiskey, it’s almost too easygoing (I made the same comment about last year’s William Larue Weller bottling). The main theme to this whiskey is lush toffee sweetness and, like last year’s expression, some vanilla fudge, nougat, and molasses. Underlying notes of dates, tobacco, dark berried fruit, spearmint, and a hit of coffee round out the palate. Given the higher strength, it’s a true value bourbon -- almost like getting two bottles in one. A very nice whiskey but, when brought down to comparable strength, the Eagle Rare 17 has more complexity.",65.0,90,70.9,2.0
792,Lew Bryson,"Knob was one of the first bourbons I had when I started taking whiskey seriously, and it’s still a kicker. No-nonsense, flint-hard nose: slickly-polished oak furniture, cinnamon stick, cracked rye, wet cornmeal, hard candies. Bang! A lean whiskey that gets in your mouth and explodes with rye spice and cinnamon candy, a sharp wedge that opens you right up. The finish echoes: oak, a dying fire, clean and almost crisp. Emphatic, bright, and swift. Value Pick",32.0,90,50.0,2.0
793,Fred Minnick,"The Angel’s Envy Cask Strength port cask finished bourbon has developed a cult following, and it’s easy to see why. Jumping out are marshmallow, caramel, vanilla, roasted nuts, with a hint of cardamom, coffee, and nutmeg, but true beauty lies in the pronounced pumpkin pie, dark chocolate, raw pine nut, caramel, and sweet maltiness. I’d love for this whiskey to finish longer, but it does give a hint of nutmeg toward the end. Sourced whiskey.",170.0,90,63.95,2.0
794,Fred Minnick,"From Kentucky, the journey begins with generous at-the-fair candy corn and subtle hints of vanilla, caramel, and smoke. I find the caramelized grains and spice just as appealing.

797,John Hansell,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

Similar sweet notes as its sibling aged in floor #1 (caramel, honey, ripe fruit), but with an additional layer of dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla, clove) to accompany it. It has all the components of a fine bourbon, and it’s also nicely balanced, with good oak grip on the finish. The best of the three. Price is per 375 ml",47.0,90,45.0,2.0
798,John Hansell,"The aromas are tightly bound, but a little water releases them nicely. A powerful dram, with tarry, leafy, coal ash, caramel apple, and driftwood notes; even a little soapy (not necessarily a negative). More subtle floral notes (heather, violet), Earl Grey tea, and smoked fish. Long, damp peat smoke and charcoal finish.",75.0,90,57.9,
800,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1969, the oldest Bunnahabhain ever released was matured in second-fill sherry butts. The nose yields sweet resin, marzipan, ginger, glacé cherries, a hint of cloves, and red berries. The silky palate features Jaffa oranges, dark chocolate, prunes, and more glacé cherries. The finish dries steadily, with slightly bitter tea, white pepper, a savory note, and quite subtle oak tannins for a dram of this vintage. (198 bottles)",,90,41.8,1.0
801,John Hansell,"Distilled at Buffalo Trace in Kentucky but aged mostly in Virginia at the A. Smith Bowman distillery. This is a bold, hearty bourbon: not elegant or refined, rather a bit mean and moody at times. Sweeter, gentler notes of vanilla, caramel, nougat, mocha, and candied fruit wrestle with more aggressive tobacco, leather, and damp forest floor notes. Warming, cinnamon-tinged, gripping finish. A rewarding whiskey for those with an adventurous soul.",70.0,90,69.3,
803,John Hansell,"A bright and lively bourbon. Nicely balanced, too, with notes of caramel custard, red licorice, orange marmalade, golden raisin, and coconut cream, underpinned by crisp rye and tantalizing cinnamon. A gently sweetish whiskey -- not cloying in any way. In fact, it’s very drinkable. And it’s a whiskey that demonstrates great harmony between youth and maturity.",26.0,90,43.3,2.0
805,John Hansell,"Straw color. Fresh, appetizing aroma. Light-medium body. Nicely balanced flavors. Both the aroma and palate express notes of spices (Dijon mustard), brine, exotic peppers, caramel, and fruit. Lingering finish.",85.0,90,61.5,1.0
807,John Hansell,"Fresh, vibrant. Appetizingly briny, with notes of seaweed, fishnets, lemongrass, smoke, and damp peat. A bed of light toffee provides contrast and balance. It finishes with a knockout punch: powerfully peppery and salty. This whisky remains a beautifully dynamic and bold whisky.",50.0,90,45.8,1.0
808,Fred Minnick,"Initially it’s a nut-filled experience with toasted walnuts, pecans, and Brazil nuts, but an atypical spice appears that’s just lovely. Smoked hatch chiles mingle with rounded notes of cinnamon, créme brûlée, Bananas Foster, orange, canned peaches, caramel chew, and toffee. The pepper spices reappear for a grand finish.",30.0,90,46.85,2.0
809,John Hansell,"Matured in amoroso casks. The amoroso softens Talisker’s fiery personality and adds a gentle sweetness not normally found in Talisker. There’s a lot going on here-notes of toffee and dark chocolate, layered with bitter orange, seaweed, kippers, smoked nuts, damp peat, and kalamata olives, finishing with a peppery glow. Not an every day dram-one has to be in the mood for a whisky like this. (With sausages during brunch, perhaps?)",65.0,90,45.6,1.0
810,Geoffrey Kleinman,"An American single malt whiskey that brings together the sensibilities of American craft with traditional Scottish and Irish styles with great result. Hogshead’s nose is bright and acidic, with pear, apple, maple, cinnamon, and malted grain. The palate is much spicier than expected, but enjoyably so, with black pepper, oak, cinnamon, and clove mixing well with honeyed malt and pear. The finish is long and slightly dry with a dash of heat. An impressive entry in the craft category.",40.0,90,46.0,
811,Fred Minnick,"It opens with a crust of salt and Flintstones vitamins in honey, almond paste, and caramel. Then pumice, pear, canned peaches, and baked apples jump into the mix, followed by Nutella, Cheerios, candied pecans, and chocolate. As the medium to long finish sets in, slight hints of smoke appear and suggest it would pair great with a bold cigar. A drop of water only makes it better.",90.0,90,53.8,2.0
812,Gavin Smith,"This Perthshire single malt was distilled in 1993 and aged in European oak sherry butts. Brittle toffee, black treacle, aniseed, black pepper, and cigar boxes feature on the rich nose. The bold palate yields full, creamy sherry notes, almonds, ginger, old leather, and a slightly savory tang. Long, warming, and peppery in the finish. (5,514 bottles)",460.0,90,58.4,1.0
813,John Hansell,"Very dry, fragrant and spicy. Medium bodied, but firm. Initial, flirtatious notes of honey, creamy caramel and oatcakes quickly become dry and arid, with a foundation of leather and oak shavings. The whisky is peppered throughout with notes of anise, coffee, dried herbs and undertones of Madeira. Very forward and bullishly dry for its age, and more intense than the standard Cragganmore bottling. It’s rare for a whisky this young to be so complex.",125.0,90,60.1,1.0
814,Gavin Smith,"A nose of bold sherry, worn leather, figs, malt, white pepper, and ginger. Ultimately, a mildly savory note. Full-bodied on the palate, with overripe damsons and more ginger; spicy sherry and dried fruits develop. Medium to long in the finish, with persistent prickly spices, black coffee, and fragrant oak. (240 bottles for the U.S.)",900.0,90,48.2,1.0
815,John Hansell,"Independent bottlings of Cragganmore are hard to come by, and this one is a beauty. Cragganmore is not rich, heavy, or sweet like many Speyside whiskies. This one is medium-bodied, yet firm. It is clean on the palate throughout (with a brief honeyed vanilla note before becoming dry), and it is loaded with spice and dried fruits that continue to evolve. Long, lingering, finish. The decision to forego chill-filtering certainly reveals more of this whisky’s subtle, yet persistent, complexity.",59.0,90,46.0,1.0
816,John Hansell,"A whisky that defies its age. It is remarkably clean and fresh, with no suggestion of excessive oak. Fragrant aroma, with notes of vanilla, coconut, honeyed malt, cereal grain, and linseed. Similar follow through on the palate, with a texture that is soft, lightly oily, and soothing. Clean finish. One of the best Tamdhu whiskies I’ve tasted.",250.0,90,40.2,1.0
818,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Insights developed from four generations making fine California wine are applied brilliantly to Masterson’s 100% rye-grain whisky. Finishing in Hungarian oak barrels lends softness to warm glowing spices, ripe Bing cherries, Granny Smith apples, and cocoa powder. Sandalwood follows, then Humbugs, farmy notes, sweet grainy beer mash, fragrant esters, and candy canes, on a slippery palate. Long, spicy, vanilla finish.",89.0,90,45.0,4.0
819,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Rum barrels replace port wood in a reformulated Pike Creek. The sweetness of the rum finish accommodates higher proof and an extra 5% shot of rye, making this Pike Creek slightly fatter than the original. Crisp clean wood, sweet earthy fruitiness, brisk peppers, lovely tongue-tingling clove-like glow, cigarette tobacco, salt water taffy, raisins, dark plums, and tart fruit.",30.0,90,42.0,4.0
820,John Hansell,"Antique gold color. Fragrant aroma, with floral notes, soft honey tones, vanilla, and delicate fruit (orange and lemon). Light to medium in body and soft in texture. Flavors are similar to the whisky's aroma, very clean, and with great balance-the woody notes one would expect from a whisky this old are kept in check.",230.0,90,45.0,1.0
821,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A malted rye whiskey, aged in new, bourbon, and Germain-Robin cognac barrels. Cereal grains are the star of this nose, which supports the rye grain with oak and cinnamon spice. The palate follows the grain-focused nose and is a carefully crafted love note to rye grain, featuring multi-grain cereal, cinnamon, ginger, sawdust, and a touch of oak. The finish is all dark chocolate, rye grain, and cinnamon spice; a delicious, close to expertly-crafted whiskey.",65.0,90,44.1,3.0
832,John Hansell,"Very floral and fragrant. Gently sweet, too: apple tart laced with cinnamon, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup.  Well-defined oak and crisp, dry spice (cinnamon, anise, cocoa, nutmeg) balance the sweetness. An interesting whiskey: big in some ways, yet elegant in others",90.0,90,50.9,2.0
834,John Hansell,"Buffalo Trace distilled a wheated bourbon and aged barrels from the same distillation date on three different floors (1, 5 and 9) for 12 ½ years to see what the differences would be. This is similar to an experiment they conducted last year using a rye mashbill bourbon. As you will see, the higher the floor, the more intense the flavors, and the greater the wood influence.

Gentle and easygoing. Creamy texture, with layered sweet notes of caramel, vanilla, marzipan, and crème brûlée. Soft background spice lingers on a delicate, soothing finish. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,90,45.0,2.0
836,John Hansell,"Richly flavored and surprisingly sweet on the nose and front of the palate. A tactile whiskey: creamy, yet becoming resinous toward the finish. Notes of vanilla saltwater taffy, roasted nuts, tobacco, and molasses. An intriguing whiskey, and my favorite of the three.",47.0,90,45.0,2.0
837,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Aged for 4 years and bottled in bond, this bourbon has a mash of Arkansas grown grains, including 73% corn, 9% wheat, and 18% barley. Dark amber in color, a robust nose spotlights cinnamon, oak, and black pepper. The palate is an enjoyable journey from sweet caramel corn to spicy cinnamon and oak. Cinnamon is the star in the mid-palate, where it’s well supported by the underlying alcohol. A long and slightly dry finish caps off a craft whiskey done right.",50.0,90,50.0,3.0
838,Lew Bryson,"Distilled from Bear Republic Big Bear Black Stout, alambic pot distilled, aged 29 months in used French oak. Gooey nose, with lots of dark chocolate, toffee, fruit (ripe honeydew, Asian pear, red plum); no hint of the 49.5% ABV heat. Deliciously layered palate: dry malt, juicy fruit, and savory wood spice, sweet malt and chocolate, and a finish that’s sweet, light, and quite refreshing and inviting. Lives up to the Charbay hype!",135.0,90,49.5,3.0
840,John Hansell,"An elegant bourbon, and very drinkable too! Its flavors are clean and tight, with bright fruit (nectarine, tangerine,
pineapple), soft coconut, honeyed vanilla, cotton candy, and subtle gin botanicals. Polished leather and a hint of dark chocolate on the finish. Great anytime. (Exclusive to Capital City Package.)",30.0,90,45.0,2.0
842,Fred Minnick,"Initially, it’s extremely perfume-like, with floral notes often found in fragrances. Then the fruit completely takes over: banana, blueberry, plums, cherry, apple, pear, and quince. Of these, the banana lingers until chocolate and vanilla enter the picture, followed by hints of green pepper and graham cracker. Then, boom, baking spices launch into a lovely medium to long finish.",200.0,90,62.25,2.0
844,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Each batch is a little bit different, this one leaning to sweet orchard fruits, nutty barley, and hot spicy rye. Butterscotch and vanilla on the nose translate well onto the palate. Brisk peppery spice underlies developing layers, adding another dimension of complexity to an already broad range of flavors. Hints of oak tannins on the finish remind us this was finished in Canadian wood.",50.0,90,40.0,
850,John Hansell,"Aged slightly more than 9 years. (The annual single barrel releases jumped last year from approximately 10 years old to 9 years old, with both a 2005 and 2006 vintage released in the same year.) A mélange of fruit (apricot, candied citrus, pineapple, golden raisin) spiked with fresh mint and cinnamon on a bed of caramel and vanilla. In true form, this bourbon is flavorful and well-rounded.",30.0,90,43.3,
851,John Hansell,"Double cask matured. More subtle and complex than the new 12 year old, and not as sweet. Creamy in texture and floral on the nose, with dried vanilla, gentle spice, nectarine, kiwi, plum, and lemon gum drops. Soft, elegant finish with a hint of mint. Great balance of a variety of flavors and lots of finesse. A well-crafted whisky!",55.0,90,43.0,1.0
853,John Hansell,"Amber, with shades of ruby. Notes of complex honey-drenched fruit (sultana, marmalade, peaches, apples), toffee, treacle, and hint of mint. Full, rich texture and lush body. Long, warming, moderately spicy finish.",60.0,90,60.0,1.0
854,John Hansell,"Port Ellen, for sure! Very old-fashioned in nature: intertwined notes of tarry rope, coal soot, rooty peat, toffee, dark chocolate, and walnuts, spiked with coffee bean, anise, cracked peppercorn, and a hint of ginger. Dry, smoky, long, slightly austere finish. This Port Ellen is a bit moody (maybe even has an attitude problem), but I’m not complaining.",275.0,90,54.1,1.0
855,John Hansell,"This (rather young) Islay distillery’s second release. Like the first, it’s aged for about three years and then finished in sherry casks—this time for a shorter two and a half months. Its flavor is similar to the first release.
Once again, I am quite impressed. It’s very mature for its age, with good viscosity, showing smoldering peat, coal tar, black licorice stick, burnt dark berried fruit, thick-cut marmalade, shoo-fly pie (think molasses), toffee apple, cocoa powder, cinnamon, and a suggestion of wet sheep. Long, peat smoke finish.£47",76.0,90,46.0,
857,Gavin Smith,"This offers a slightly oily nose, with orchard fruits, vanilla, cocoa powder, nutmeg, cucumber sprinkled with white pepper, and very subtle smoke. Powerful flavors of peppery fruit and malt on the palate, with honey, butterscotch, milk chocolate, cinnamon, and mellow oak. The finish is lengthy and redolent of toffee apples.",90.0,90,47.2,1.0
858,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Generously oaked, with toasty oak drive delivering brown spices and earthy dried apple on the nose. The palate pours sweet and rich, with warm corn porridge underscored with dark molasses and maple flavors. There is a lot to like here, from the boiled peanuts to a spiced palate, as the young, house-made whiskey imparts its verve to the 9 year old Indiana bourbon.",55.0,90,50.0,3.0
859,Gavin Smith,"Aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks; the nose is initially relatively reticent, slightly earthy, with a hint of drinking chocolate, emerging sherry notes, and subtle orange. Toffee, more chocolate, and spicy dried fruits on the relatively full-bodied palate. Long in the finish, with wood spices.",55.0,90,40.0,1.0
862,John Hansell,"Nicely rounded and very drinkable. Warming cinnamon, vanilla bean, and dried fruit, wrapped up in creamy caramel and light toffee. Pleasant, gently sweet finish. Great anytime. 375ml",47.0,90,45.0,2.0
863,Gavin Smith,"Quantities of Optic and Oxbridge barley varieties were grown on eight Islay family farms during 2009, and the following year this grain was distilled, then matured in bourbon and French wine casks. The nose offers ginger, melon, malt, sweet (lit) pipe tobacco, freshly baled straw, resin, vanilla, and spice. Chewy in the mouth; oily, with toffee spices and youthful oak notes. The finish features oysters with lemon squeezed over them.",65.0,90,50.0,1.0
864,Dave Broom,"No hiding that this is one of BenRiach’s peated variants, with smoke coming at you like an out of control garden bonfire, but the inherent sweetness of the distillery character adds a counterpoint: cinnamon-dusted apples baking in the fire, before angelica and cannabis (someone tells me) come through. The interplay between fruits and grassy smoke continues on the palate alongside toffee, nougat, peach syrup, and salty licorice before the smoke returns. A belter. And a great price.",80.0,90,46.0,1.0
865,Dave Broom,"Sherry butt once more, but this is much more relaxed in its attentions — think Montgomery Clift seducing Elizabeth Taylor rather than De Niro chatting up Liza Minelli. Sweetness is the key here, gentle and slightly caramelized, with touches of molasses-like concentration and even a whiff of the top of a crème brûlée. The palate surprises with its continued freshness; apple and the distillery’s distinctive earthy richness. Great balance.£382",540.0,90,51.1,1.0
866,Dave Broom,"The introductory expression of the range shows a further example of the widening of the Mortlach style. Stewed and dried fruits mingle with light earth notes, wet Labrador, supple shoe leather, and varnish. A drop of water is all that’s needed to add a savory element and even some funky fruitiness reminiscent of cooking agave. The palate is big and chocolaty with some meat underneath. Hefty but elegant. The distillery character is not only intact, but enhanced. £55/500 ml",93.0,90,43.4,1.0
867,Dave Broom,"The youngest of this Family Cask selection shows Glenfarclas in a surprisingly citric light, with plenty of citrus peels — tangerine, marmalade, and orange syrup, as well as sultana, suede, wax polish (surprising in a youngish dram), and chocolate — a recurring theme here. It is almost as if all the more lifted elements in each of the previous casks have here united. Mature, but highly expressive, and a great starter.  £172",270.0,90,55.6,1.0
868,Dave Broom,"This is Rare Old at higher strength for folks who haunt Travel Retail outlets. The upping of strength also changes the dynamic, making things sweeter with mushed berries and Seville orange, but also deeper, with more overt meatiness, stewed tea, and the same varnished note. Dense, thick, stewed orchard fruits are on the palate alongside some acetone and, with water, burning rosemary and dry licorice. Similar, but with more heft. £75/500 ml",127.0,90,49.0,1.0
870,Gavin Smith,"Part of anCnoc’s Peaty Collection, Cutter has been distilled from malt peated to 20.5 ppm. The result is a dram with a nose of ashy peat and medicine cabinets, backed by vanilla and canned apricots. Rich peat on the palate, with citrus fruit and crème brûlée. The slightly oily finish is long and bonfire-like.",65.0,90,46.0,1.0
872,Dave Broom,"Although one of the old Speyside crew (along with Mortlach, Glenfarclas, and Macallan) Balmenach has, inexplicably in my mind, never even achieved cult status. It has simply kept on making rich, powerful, worm tub-condensed spirit for a multitude of blends. This rare bottling therefore is hugely welcome and shows a friskier than usual side — earthy for sure and a lick of leather as well, but also walnut and sultana. The palate is deep and languorous with a savory edge. £145 (Not available in the U.S.)",232.0,90,56.3,1.0
874,Gavin Smith,"This veteran expression from Deanston Distillery was matured in refill bourbon casks before spending no fewer than 10 years in oloroso sherry butts. Rose petals, fresh pineapple, clotted cream, cinnamon, and dusty oak on the enticing nose. Unctuous in the mouth, with apple pie, cinnamon, hazelnuts, and ginger. Drying slowly to pleasing fruity, tannic notes. Extremely long finish, with a persistent citric tang. (Less than 500 bottles globally)",1215.0,90,45.6,1.0
875,Dave Broom,"We had some new Benromachs from Gordon & MacPhail last issue that illustrated what the firm has been up to since it purchased the site in 1992. This release comes from its previous incarnation as part of DCL. The elegant, mature nose shows an ‘Old Speyside’ light smokiness alongside barley, cacao, cigar humidor, and potpourri. The palate is gentle and unctuous with some sherried touches, while the smoke reruns on the very end. £150 (Not available in the U.S.)",240.0,90,43.0,1.0
877,Gavin Smith,"The latest limited release of 21 year old Springbank has been matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Sherry and bourbon notes are well integrated on the early nose, which follows up with succulent tropical fruits, toffee, and a whiff of earthy peat. The palate is complex, confident, and oily, with dry sherry notes, almonds, figs, vanilla, wood smoke, and a hint of the sea. The lengthy finish boasts caramel, cinnamon, brine, and soft peat. £182",307.0,90,46.0,1.0
878,Dave Broom,"Here is Macallan in full-blown masculine mode. Initially it seems tight and (sherry) cask driven, but soon you are taken into a winter kitchen with scents of venison, and appropriate rowanberry edges adding a sweet and sour fruitiness. That wild berry note is given another nudge by a whiff of burning juniper. The palate shows it to be thick with a quivering mass of black fruits, and a finish of molasses and licorice. A feast. £75",117.0,90,51.6,1.0
880,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A symphony of delicate exotic fruits in light syrup. The silky mouthfeel bolsters flourishes of sourish kumquats and tangerines, while a delicate oaky foundation supports bursts of hot peppery spices. Sweet Christmas spices harmonize gently with creamy vanilla. Persimmon, mild pears, sweet lemon, sandalwood, and hints of incense each take their turn. The sweet citrus finish is a fitting finale to a subtle yet complex and seamlessly integrated dram that carefully balances heat with fruit. (Taiwan only) NT$2,500",79.0,90,40.0,4.0
881,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A medley of well-integrated, bright flavors including acetone, green apples, soft floral perfume, vague tannins, sweet pipe tobacco, brown sugar, hints of spar varnish, fresh-cut wood, vanilla galore, soft well-integrated spices, and subdued white pepper. It feels like corn syrup, with hot spices on the sides of the tongue and hints of oak lumber throughout. Rich and full, yet light, fresh, and estery. Long, lingering, hot spices on a sweet, slightly fruity finish. Ends on cinnamon bark. (U.S. only)",65.0,90,45.0,4.0
883,Lew Bryson,"More Canadian core rye from WhistlePig, this time at full-bore. It’s strong with rye, sweet with melon and dark chocolate notes, but with a wood character like the unfinished inside of an antique oak wardrobe. The antique wood is strong in the mouth, an oddly elegant note, but afterward comes the melon and chocolate, and oily, coiling rye. Interestingly complicated; a bit hard to make friends, but worth the time and effort.",189.0,90,58.9,4.0
885,Dave Broom,"This is one of a trio from Chivas Bros., who every year release limited editions of 500 ml cask strength bottlings from a selection of its estates. These are predominantly only for sale on site or by mail order through www.maltwhiskydistilleries.com.

My pick of this batch. Strathisla’s a small, traditional distillery whose make is mostly pressed into service for the Chivas Regal blends. It’s a hard to pin down malt, and it’s this elusive character that shows here: firm then soft, fragrant then deep. The nose is intense and spicy with wax, nougat, chocolate, hazelnut, and fresh-opened banana. The palate is explosive with real presence and power, whose firm core is softened by honey and poached fruits. Complex is the word. £37",59.0,90,55.3,
886,Dave Broom,"Amber. Very meaty, with a touch of cordite, then dark fruits, wet earth, and autumn woods, cut with spicy licorice and Darjeeling tea. Water brings down this exuberance, adding iris and whole grain bread. The palate has typical, full-on Mortlach brawny muscle, with chestnut honey-glazed venison. Water bringing out sweetness, but without ever losing that glowering core. Lovers of the old 16 year old apply here.",295.0,90,58.6,1.0
889,Gavin Smith,"Companta—Gaelic for friendship—is the fifth of Glenmorangie’s Private Edition releases. It comprises a blend of whiskies finished in Clos de Tart Grand Cru wine casks and in fortified wine casks from Côtes du Rhône. Big fruity, leathery notes on the nose. Spicy, with sultanas, almonds, and icing sugar. The palate is rich and complex, with cocoa powder, nutmeg, more leather, and redcurrants. Long and fruity in the finish, with vibrant spices. Red berries predominate.",99.0,90,46.0,1.0
890,Dave Broom,"Rooted in the earth and redolent of late autumn. There’s a plummy thread that runs through this range; here we’ve gone to prune, mixed with dried cherries, and a sweet/savory edge whose whiff of heavy rose petal is reminiscent of Barolo. Robust, yet sweet. Heady, like chocolate-covered Turkish Delight. The palate has oloroso notes alongside Assam-like tannins. One to have with water on the side. Classical in structure and aromatics, but that vinous sweetness is new. £120",187.0,90,43.0,1.0
892,John Hansell,"A very clean whisky, with fragrant dried flowers, aromas of germinating barley, textured honey, vanilla waver, coconut cream and teasing fresh pineapple.

893,Gavin Smith,"Benromach’s first triple-distilled single malt was matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers peaches with a wisp of sweet smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lime. Voluptuous and very sweet on the palate; intense sugary orchard fruits and stem ginger, with the characteristic Benromach peat smoke dialed back. The finish embraces insistent black pepper, nutmeg, and very mild peat. £45",59.0,90,50.0,1.0
894,John Hansell,"Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks and bottled unfiltered and at natural cask strength. This takes the usually subtle Glenlivet and makes it more vibrant, amplifying its flavors while accentuating the bourbon oak. Tight notes of honeyed malt, vanilla bean, toasted oak, bright fruit, and nuts, are peppered with more subtle floral and spice notes. Dry, spicy finish. A Glenlivet with pizzazz.",60.0,90,57.2,1.0
895,John Hansell,"Antique amber color. This whisky maintains the elegance cherished by Glenlivet enthusiasts, but finishing the whisky in limousin oak produces a whisky of deeper wood notes, particularly wood spices (vanilla, sandalwood, perhaps even mint) and floral notes. It’s rich, complex, and dry-especially on the finish.",36.0,90,40.0,1.0
897,John Hansell,"Younger bottlings of Glenlivet are often quite elegant and subtle. But such finesse isn’t always evident in older expressions, which often become dominated by sherry and oak. This one, at 35 years of age, demonstrates plenty of elegance and finesse. What impresses me most about this whisky is that you wouldn’t know it was 35 year old just by taste. It isn’t the least bit tired on the palate, and it is very clean, without the excessive woodiness often found in whiskies of this age. Plus, the balance of flavors is impeccable-vanilla, honeyed malt, peaches, pineapple, heather, and just a touch of oak. A very polished, refined whisky.",155.0,90,43.1,1.0
898,Dave Broom,"There’s a fascinating journey taking place here. The nose takes you indoors; caramelized tropical fruits, coffee cake, a spent fire in the grate, and just the merest whiff of the waves hitting the beach. The palate, however, places you squarely aboard a yacht under sail: salt spray, deck and engine oil, worn leather upholstery. It seems way more mature than 12 years. The intensity is lost with water, but you gain more smoke. A great bottling.  £59",92.0,90,56.1,1.0
899,Gavin Smith,"Initially, the nose is very different than that of the younger Glen Deverons, with brown paper and malt vinegar. Becoming buttery, with coconut ice and citrus fruit. Ultimately, a caramel note reminiscent of the 16 year old (see below). Rich and waxy on the palate, with dark berry fruits, almonds, vanilla, and treacle. Sweet and sour. The medium-length finish offers green berries and a hint of aniseed. Real depth of flavor and individuality here.

900,Dave Broom,"Another that should need no introduction. The thing to look for in Talisker, as with all smoky whiskies, is sweetness that gives the requisite balance to the drying effect of smoke. Underneath Talisker’s smoke, which ain't as all-pervading as Lagavulin, is a sweet pear-like quality. When young there are notes of the land: heather, moor, sweet seaweed, and a finish that has a distinctive cracked black pepper hit.",50.0,90,45.8,1.0
901,Dave Broom,"Rich amber in hue, sweet, and mellow with initial amontillado sherry notes that give way to Mortlach meatiness; here a lamb tagine with prune, apricot, and gravy juices. This elegance gives way to a fascinating palate mix of the sweet and the savory with citrus, sultana, and a rowanberry jab on the end mingling with just a bit of smoke. Everything mellowed by time and oak. Very good indeed. £99",157.0,90,59.4,1.0
902,Dave Broom,"Light amber. The initial impression is one of bulk. There are heavy florals — think lilies and stewed white fruit, and just-overripe banana — but this is given a mysterious extra heft by an underpinning of a light meatiness, accompanied by a tiny lift of (good) sulfur. The palate is, unsurprisingly, thick and creamy with huge fruit that fills the mouth. A highly physical, old-style Speyside dram with classic distillery character. A statement whisky that is a must-try.",53.0,90,46.0,1.0
903,John Hansell,"Very dynamic, complex, and powerful. Here’s what I’m picking up, in somewhat descending order in taste profile: leafy smoke, coal tar, mocha fudge with dark chocolate chips, smoked olive, peppered seaweed salad, fruit (lemon, lime), genever, brine-tinged grass, and (with some coaxing) floral notes (violet?). Compared to last year’s debut release of Supernova, this one is certainly comparable, but I feel it’s a tad richer, with more leafy smoke and ripe barley. It also seems a bit more polished, less aggressive. I like it a little more than its predecessor (rated 89).",130.0,90,60.1,1.0
904,Dave Broom,"This latest installment of the Tun 1401 series is a classic expression of old, mature Balvenie, where a waxiness akin to furniture polish slides into mead-like aromas; actually more like metheglin, as there’s an herbal, spiced element. Its textural richness means it is best with water on the side, allowing deep earthy, licorice, and cigar ash tones to develop, along with just the lightest squeeze of tannin. (U.S. only.)",250.0,90,49.3,1.0
906,Dave Broom,"The oldest of a new three-strong range from Glenrothes called the Manse Brae series; the youngest component here is 21 years old. Serious and lightly meaty, the savory characters come at you, mixing gun smoke with cypress, sandalwood, dark chocolate, and dunnage warehouse. The headiness of moist forest floor continues on the tongue along with a burst of honeyed peach. Moving in many directions simultaneously…and slowly. Keep this neat. Classic Rothes. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €140",188.0,90,43.0,1.0
907,Dave Broom,"Light gold. A beautiful oxidized note, with soft fruitcake, steamed pudding, a little hint of overripe fruits, and sweet spices. As it opens, there’s barley sugar sweets, then custard tart with nutmeg, clover honey, and marzipan. Complex, in other words. Water shows how well-layered it is. It starts sweetly in the mouth with a thick, honeyed texture, which becomes more delicate with water. Elegant, long, and a great example of mature ’Rothes. £80",117.0,90,48.4,1.0
908,Dave Broom,"Ian MacLeod’s first release of Tamdhu was a belter. Now, finally, it’s been joined by this high-strength NAS. There’s no hint of the high strength on the nose, which is all caramel toffee and shortbread, backed with sultana-like sherry cask influence. The palate is the same: nut, dark fruits, and date. Hugely approachable. With water, it’s a matter of…chocolate? Maltesers! All you want in a sherried whisky, and it won’t burn a hole in your wallet either. £60",88.0,90,58.8,1.0
911,Gavin Smith,"Ealanta is the fourth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series, and has been aged in heavily-charred virgin white oak casks from Missouri for nineteen years. The result is a nose of American cream soda, milk chocolate, fudge, pineapple, and honey; spicy and creamy. Silky smooth in the mouth, with brittle toffee and orange notes; gently herbal, with a suggestion of cloves and newly-sawn wood. Long in the finish, with citrus fruit, oak, aniseed, and an enduring spicy creaminess.",119.0,90,46.0,1.0
912,Dave Broom,"More smoke than is common from this distillery and age. The aromas are food-related: initially roast ham with caramelized sugars, then a clambake, then oven-roasted lobster. With water, a distinct whiff of the goat shed (nice, by the way). The palate is refined and mature, but with fresh fruits retained, with oak and smoke beautifully integrated. A mature Caol Ila in similar vein to the excellent (and significantly more keenly priced) 25 year old. (7,638 bottles)",700.0,90,55.1,1.0
913,John Hansell,"Waves of fruit (apple pie, orange marmalade, sultana, ripe pineapple), accented with notes of dark chocolate, roasted nuts, and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, evergreen), particularly on the finish. (In the past, I’ve thought that a couple of these limited edition Glemorangie wood finishes were a little overdone with the finishing, but not this one).",450.0,90,46.0,1.0
914,Dave Broom,"Robust Port Charlotte character, with salami and jamon serrano to the fore. Somewhat like eating a chorizo and roasted red pepper sandwich on the beach on a summer’s day, but it retains the sweet freshness of the distillery character. With water, the lovely smell of cow’s breath. There’s dry smoke to start with on the palate, becoming sweet (flash-fried scallop) with sugared almond on the finish. For me, PC comes fully of age here. £55",87.0,90,50.0,1.0
915,John Hansell,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Golden honey Aroma: Lush and mouthwatering. Notes of honey, peaches in syrup, golden raisins, coconut, vanilla, and background resinous oak. Palate: Creamy and velvety in texture.

916,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Much of Caol Ila’s malt goes into Johnnie Walker blends, so it’s a rare treat to see a cask strength offering. This release is Caol Ila on steroids, featuring a deeply smoky and meaty nose with bacon, campfire, leather, sea salt, and iodine. On the palate, the smoky fire continues to burn with intense smoke and salt combined with sweet honey malt.  An extremely long finish will have you exhaling smoke long after the dram is gone. (Julio’s Liquors only)",130.0,90,57.5,1.0
918,John Hansell,"This whiskey’s mashbill includes both rye and wheat. (Most bourbons contain one or the other, and usually it’s rye.) The sweet, inviting mellowness of the wheat is there; so is the spicy zing of the rye. Look for creamy caramel and soft vanilla peppered with fresh mint and warming cinnamon. Firm oak grip on the finish, with lingering spice. Dynamic and invigorating.",70.0,90,50.0,2.0
919,Adam Polonski,"On the nose, cherry tart baked over a fireplace: rich red fruit with a whiff of soot and some chalky minerality. A lot of warmth on the palate, with biscotti, almond, toffee, and warm caramel apple topped with sweet vanilla cream, and chocolate ganache on the side. Good, creamy texture, with some sharp peppery tinges. A 9 year old Tennessee bourbon selected by and bottled for Doc’s Wine, Spirits and More in Memphis, Tennessee. (152 bottles)",50.0,90,55.0,2.0
920,Fred Minnick,"When the caramel train comes, it rarely returns after such strong earthy notes of roots, hay, and soil. It’s the same story in the next round: first, pan-fried sweet potatoes and parsnips dominate; caramel returns with vanilla, allspice, and white pepper. Then the odd but welcomed combo of campfire-smoked marshmallows and gingersnaps just before a long caramel finish. Very unique.",130.0,90,60.9,2.0
921,Gavin Smith,"The nose is pleasingly floral, with soft spice, malt, heather in bloom, and even a suggestion of violets. Well textured on the palate, oily and nutty, with tropical fruits, honey, milk chocolate, vanilla, and malt. The finish is lengthy, with a hint of citrus and warming spices. (Cask no. 69; 287 bottles)",100.0,90,58.2,
922,Gavin Smith,"Thor is the first in Highland Park’s new cask strength Valhalla Collection, with a fresh expression inspired by the Nordic gods due to be released annually over the next four years. Ginger, sherry, Christmas spices, wood smoke, vanilla, and a hint of lemon on the complex, confident nose. Notably spicy in the mouth, with peaches, clotted cream, sherry, and more smoke. Long in the finish, with lots of ginger, a little aniseed, and finally, spicy peat.",200.0,90,52.1,1.0
923,Dave Broom,"“Ardbeg in Perpetuum” would mean “Ardbeg forever.” It’s made up of a mélange of different casks: American oak, refill, French oak…and others. Intense, marine, with pineapple, wet moss, tar, cracked black pepper, and a nuttiness. The palate is oily, sweet, with smoked cream, balanced by a very pure acidity, then soot and char. Will the fact that it isn’t an extreme Ardbeg satisfy everyone? Probably not. Is it a bloody good session drink? Damn right it is. (200th anniversary bottling)",100.0,90,47.4,1.0
924,John Hansell,"An exciting blend of straight rye whiskeys finished in French oak and port barrels. Beautifully spiced (warming cinnamon, crisp mint), tamed by caramel and vanilla fudge. Red and black raspberry, plum, dried citrus, and wood shavings add complexity. Warming finish. Nicely balanced and very distinctive.

927,John Hansell,"Amber color. Lush, rich aromas of rummy toffee, nuts, vanilla, with interwoven notes of glazed fruit. On the heavy side of medium in body, and silky. There are layers of sweetness on the palate (toffee, caramel, marzipan and dates), becoming nutty with a pleasing oak woodiness to balance the sweetness. Long, dryish finish with notes of spice and fruit.",70.0,90,43.0,1.0
930,Dave Broom,"Using barley grown on Rockside Farm, this is fresh, sweet (agave syrup), delicate, and lightly buttery, with touches of lily of the valley and lemon sponge cake mix. The cereal character is restrained, with a charred hint on the palate along with banana, mandarin, cassia, and pink marshmallows (untoasted). The Laddie’s floral notes emerge late, and the whiff of white pepper on the end is all there is to remind you of its youth. A classy young whisky. £45",72.0,90,50.0,
931,Geoffrey Kleinman,"An old-style whisky that harkens back to a time when Scotland wasn’t sliced and diced by region, but defined by style. This is meaty with a capital M, with a rich, oily, deep character. On the palate it’s big and beautiful, with salt, oyster shell, honey, roasted green pepper, smoke, dried fruit, beef jerky, leather, and oak. Earthy peat smoke dances throughout, giving support but never stealing focus. This is about as masculine as Highland whisky gets. (U.S. only)",160.0,90,56.6,1.0
932,Gavin Smith,"One of four Octomore 08 Masterclass releases, this was distilled in 2011 from Islay barley peated to 309 ppm. Fifty-six percent of the spirit was matured in first-fill bourbon casks, while the remainder was aged in European oak wine casks. Barbecue smokiness on the nose, with wet peat and citrus fruitiness. On the palate, earthy peat, full-bodied red wine, and milk chocolate. Peat smoke to the fore in the finish, with ginger and chili. (18,000 bottles)",165.0,90,61.2,1.0
934,Dave Broom,"Matured in first-fill sherry casks, here we have Bowmore at its ballsiest, with massively bold notes of prune, dried fig, salted treacle, toffee, shoe leather, rose petal, and savory maritime edges that glance toward Marmite, all of which are infiltrated by clouds of smoke. The palate has retained sweetness, mixing black cherry, pipe tobacco, and cloves. Powerful and seriously impressive with fantastic balance that retains Bowmore identity, adds richness, ups the peatiness, and leaves you under Satan’s spell.",90.0,90,56.9,1.0
937,Lew Bryson,"If you wondered when you saw “50%,” this is indeed bottled in bond whiskey, with all the requirements that go with it. The nose is just this side of hot and brings parched corn, sawn maple wood, spicy hard candy, and dry spearmint leaf. Bright and spicy on the tongue; more candy and honey, and hints of teaberry and licorice that develop into the finish. A better package of flavor and price than the earlier Taylor releases; quite enjoyable.",50.0,90,50.0,2.0
938,John Hansell,"Surprisingly lacking in oak intensity, given its age. Very creamy and soothingly sweet, with notes of honeyed vanilla, crème brûlée, sultana, orange creamsicle, peach cobbler, and a subtle array of tropical fruit. Soft and mellow on the finish. It’s very easy-drinking and should be enjoyable under most moods and circumstances.",75.0,90,45.1,2.0
940,John Hansell,"The third Taylor release, and the gentlest, most even-keeled of the three. Black raspberry, mulberry, maple syrup, oak resin, dates, soft leather, and spice (mint, cinnamon, clove, vanilla) round out the palate. Very drinkable for 100 proof, and with plenty of character.",70.0,90,50.0,2.0
942,John Hansell,"This is original “red wax” Maker’s Mark that received additional aging in barrels containing internal “seared” French oak staves. The original Maker’s Mark, being a wheated bourbon (instead of rye, which is typically used), is rather mellow and easy-to-drink. The French oak staves in “46” add firm, complex dry spices (led by warming cinnamon, followed by nutmeg and clove), herb (a suggestion of Green Chartreuse, perhaps?), and some polished leather “grip”, which dovetails well with Maker’s trademark layered sweetness (caramel, vanilla, a hint of honey). I’m also picking up some dried fruit in the background. The seared oak stave influence is somewhat aggressive, but never to the point of being excessive.",34.0,90,47.0,2.0
943,Lew Bryson,"Some of the oldest American malt whiskey joins this 30th anniversary mingling, finished in a pear eau de vie barrel, a nod to the distillery’s origins. The nose is elegant, deep, and clearly touched by the pear and oak. There’s creaminess in the mouth, a perfect weight, rich nutty sweetness balanced by wood; it all slides into a warming finish, and pear is all around. A bit too much pear, actually; though I love pears, that’s my one complaint.",400.0,90,46.0,3.0
948,John Hansell,"Distilled in 2010, this is always the youngest whiskey in the Collection, and is younger than last year’s release. I feel this is a slight liability, as it comes across a bit green and harsh for a Handy. Bold and spicy, with mint, clove, and cinnamon leading the way. Fig, caramel, and candied fruit round out the palate, but its youthfulness supersedes on the finish. One of the weaker offerings of Handy. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016.",90.0,90,63.1,2.0
949,John Hansell,"Similar to Laphroaig Quarter Cask, but also finished in oloroso sherry casks. Fruit and smoke: fleshy red berries, red licorice, toffee, ripe barley, coal tar, sun-baked seaweed, peat smoke, and a hint of coffee grounds. Tarry finish. I rated the Quarter Cask a 91, and I think this whisky is similar in quality. If you like sherry-influenced whiskies, then go for the Triple Wood. If not, then consider the Quarter Cask. (Travel Retail and European exclusive)",100.0,90,48.0,1.0
950,Fred Minnick,"One of the few remaining age-stated bourbons. Henry McKenna’s color is beautiful. You can hold it up in sunset light and just enjoy the russet and amber hues reflecting. Sweetness, savory, and floral fragrances followed by brown sugar, fresh-baked rye bread, and malt. Caramel and vanilla, with roasted pine nuts and spice, and a slight hint of strawberry lead to a long and savory finish. Balance is the point of this sipper.",33.0,90,50.0,2.0
951,Gavin Smith,"The latest batch of cask strength GlenDronach should make Aberlour a’bunadh look to its laurels. It is matured in a combination of Pedro Ximenez and oloroso sherry casks. The nose is quite perfumed, with sweet sherry, figs, nutmeg, satsumas, and candied peel. Voluptuous in the mouth, with early bright fruit notes, cinder toffee, and caramel, followed by darker sherry and raisin notes. Lightly peppery and tannic, with plain chocolate. £55",71.0,90,56.1,1.0
952,John Hansell,"Amber, with shades of ruby and gold. Aromas of complex ripe fruit (golden raisins, marmalade, cherries, apples), toffee, treacle, and hint of mint. Full, rich texture and body-almost chewy. Flavors of lush fruit drenched with honey and caramel. Long, warming, slightly spicy finish. I'm so happy to see this fine whisky finally imported to the U.S. after being available in its homeland now for about two years. The name a'bunadh literally means ""the origin"" in Gaelic, and it produced in the style of Aberlour back in the late 1800s-at the natural strength and not chill filtered. It certainly is an exciting whisky, produced in small batches (mine was Batch #6) from select oloroso sherry casks. I've noticed a slight variation in color from one batch to the next, largely due to the types of sherry casks selected.",60.0,90,59.9,
953,John Hansell,"A new expression due out in March, positioned between the 12 and 18 year old versions. A fresh and enormously drinkable whisky; very silky, with honeyed malt, delicate citrus and berry fruit, floral notes (heather and lavender), and a hint of cocoa and sea spray.",60.0,90,43.0,1.0
955,Fred Minnick,"Think carnival aromas—the good ones, anyway—meeting the campfire. Cracker Jacks, cinnamon-covered almonds, popcorn, cotton candy, marshmallows melting over graham crackers, and hints of smoldering oak. Next, coconut, caramel, and cocoa over a buttery mouthfeel with hints of toffee, banana, baked apple, and pumpkin pie appear. Toward the end, hints of black pepper and raspberry strudel surface in a medium to long finish.",36.0,90,50.0,
957,Fred Minnick,"Think of an Almond Joy candy bar: coconut, almond, and milk chocolate, followed by the candy bar’s rival flavors: caramel, vanilla, and butterscotch. Then oak, leather, cigar box, marmalade, grape jelly, a plethora of baking spices, and toffee. This beautiful study of barrel strength bourbon needs no water. Caramel in all forms, from candied to syrup, follows this home for a long and delightful finish.",85.0,90,56.05,2.0
958,Fred Minnick,"This is a re-release of the 2015 bottling. A tapestry of confectionery delights begins this journey, followed by fruit, cigar box, saddle leather, cotton candy, roasted pecans, caramel, and marshmallow. Then, it’s smoked paprika, fig, cinnamon, strawberry, and dark cherries. In the form of walnut shells, a powerful and somewhat pleasant bitterness finds the finish, with a hint of chocolate. But that bitterness does supersede the more pleasant notes, making it slightly unbalanced.",200.0,90,46.0,2.0
959,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A delicate dusting of exotic fruits and fragrant flower blossoms tailors this otherwise robust all-corn whisky to the Asian palate. Long development in the glass and in the mouth is typical of whisky that has spent many years in once-used barrels. East meets west as mellow oak caramels, pithy dragonfruit, and sour-sweet passion fruit temper fresh-cut red cedar, fragrant lilacs, bitter-sweet citrus fruit, and scorching white pepper. Rich and mouth coating, it fades slowly to sweetness. (Taiwan only) T$2,035",69.0,90,40.0,4.0
962,Fred Minnick,"Complexity right off. Cherry candied nuance, smoke, caramel, French toast, vanilla, and apricot, but then an explosion of marzipan coats the palate with vanilla, freshly baked rye bread, and hints of brown sugar, nutmeg, toasted almond, and bittersweet chocolate. Finally, cherry cola and herbs walk you to a lovely, long, bitter finish with warm undertones. This is a year-round front porch sipper.",80.0,90,48.5,2.0
963,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Opinion is seriously divided on whether this or an earlier Port Wood edition is the best thing ever to come from John K. Hall’s Forty Creek distillery in Grimsby, Ontario. A winemaker, Hall used his own port barrels to finish a mature blend of barley, corn, and rye whiskies. Stewed prunes, butterscotch, and licorice rule the nose, while the palate broadens into savory herbs, spiced fruit, sweet pipe tobacco, and hints of, yes, gunpowder. C$70",70.0,90,45.0,4.0
965,John Hansell,"Pale white wine color. Smoky, youthful aroma. There’s no surprises here-it definitely smells like a young Ardbeg. Big beautiful explosion of smoky, tarry flavors that evolve and seem to linger on the palate indefinitely. This is the first Ardbeg release I've tasted since the distillery's long shut down in the 1980s. After the shut down, they discontinued their floor maltings, so I was concerned that it might not taste like the Ardbeg of old. Ardbeg fans can let out a big sigh of relief. This one is big and gutsy-just the way we like it. My only criticism of this particular release is that it could have used about one or two more years in oak to tame some of the spirity nature of the whisky. Otherwise, this is wonderful stuff!",65.0,90,46.0,1.0
966,John Hansell,"The first 10 year old distilled by the current owners back in 2001. Lovely marriage of both bourbon and sherry casks, and quite fresh, with a maturity resembling a 12 year old, rather than 10. Smooth on the palate and very drinkable, with creamy vanilla, honeycomb, banana bread, bright lemon, melon (honeydew, cantaloupe), tangerine, candied ginger, and delicate brine. With all the Bruichladdich razzle-dazzle over the past decade, we can embrace this unpretentiously delicious Laddie with open arms.",57.0,90,46.0,1.0
967,Gavin Smith,"Recently bottled by Duncan Taylor in their non-colored, non-chill filtered NC2 range, this 13 year old expression of Springbank initially exhibits tinned pears on the nose, then smoked fish cooked in butter, coconut oil, brine, and a hint of lemon. More sweet wood smoke with time, turning to char. The palate opens with profound, sweet fruit, swiftly followed by salt, lime, and medicinal notes. Lingering, with ginger in the pleasantly oaky finish. £64",100.0,90,46.0,1.0
970,Lew Bryson,"“Contains five times more rye than A. Smith Bowman’s standard bourbon recipe,” aged 7 years and 9 months. A lean bourbon nose: sweet grain, leather, pepper, oak. Zing in the mouth! Quite spicy, with a smooth, oily feel, notes of dried apple and split fruit-tree branches, and a driving but welcome heat that lines straight through to the long, dry finish. Bold, interesting, and worthy of repeating! Limited release; mainly in Virginia.",70.0,90,50.0,2.0
971,Dave Broom,"This is quite different from the Adelphi Glen Grant bottling (below), being more cask-driven, but Glen Grant’s clean fruitiness remains, although transformed by age. Its apples are baked, with some added caramelized juices thrown in; we see apricot alongside dried lemon peel, and light, sweet spice. The waxiness here is akin to leather oil, while the oak has sufficient grip to give structure. In time, there are hints of the cellar — burlap and wet earth. Delicious, and best neat. £184",289.0,90,51.8,1.0
972,Lew Bryson,"Blends 7 and 12 year old bourbons, and a 7 year wheater, in a beautifully packaged tribute to the old brand. Typical nose—cinnamon Red Hots, milled corn, oaky zest—in balanced harmony. Beautiful stuff on the tongue: warm but not hot, expansive corn sweetness that lightens the cinnamon’s intensity, some clove, some oaky dryness. The warm finish only ends after a long embrace. Pricey for 7 year old bourbon, though; is this the future? Sourced whiskey.",105.0,90,52.5,
973,Dave Broom,"Immediately you can tell this is a complex, old, mature whisky — that hint of rancio is there, but there’s more of a beeswax character than on the Adelphi bottling (below), along with the peachiness that often appears in old drams. This is balanced by light coconut, even a hint of grist. The waxiness seen on the nose allows it to cling to the tongue, while the fruits become jellied. Benefits from a drop of water, allowing lemon and vanilla to show. £210",330.0,90,44.2,1.0
974,John Hansell,"The barrel staves used to age this whiskey dried outside in the open for 13 months. The oak influence is certainly evident—both from the cured oak staves and from the fact that the whiskey is 17 years old—but never overpowers. Plentiful spice notes (especially cinnamon and vanilla) are tamed by lovely sweetness (toffee, dates, nougat) and energized by bright fruit. Long, dry, warming finish. One of the better Taylors.",70.0,90,50.0,2.0
976,Dave Broom,"On more familiar ground with this G&M bottling of one of Speyside’s most iconic single malts, this is Macallan in full-on sherried form. Highly aromatic with powdered clove, hints of incense and fig, behind which is cacao, Bolivar cigar, and molasses. The palate has immediate smoke and surprisingly gentle tannins — the inherent oiliness of the spirit keeping any grip at bay. Very long, leathery, prune-like (think armagnac), and dense. A classic after-dinner mouth-filler.",700.0,90,43.0,1.0
977,Geoffrey Kleinman,"At 10 years old and 50% ABV, you’d expect this whiskey to pack a power punch, and while it does present solid oak and beautiful cinnamon spice, it does so with great finesse. This barrel of Henry McKenna is a great showcase of many classic bourbon notes: caramel, cinnamon, oak, orange, clove, and kettle corn. The flavors are well integrated, balanced, and backed by a wonderfully lush undertone. A solid finish that cools slightly caps off a textbook affable whiskey. (Drink Up New York only)",32.0,90,50.0,2.0
980,John Hansell,"Aged in first and (mostly) second fill sherry casks. The sherry is kept in balance and does not mask Auchentoshan’s subtle beauty. The classic Auchentoshan creamy, grassy, freshness abounds, complemented by honey-soaked almonds, cereal grain, and an array of bright fruit (citrus, sultana, mandarin). Not as polished as the Auchentoshan 21 year old, but quite entertaining. (420 bottles for the U.S.)",100.0,90,55.8,
981,John Hansell,"Amber color, with gold hues. Soft, subtly seductive aromas of creamy vanilla, crème brulee, tropical fruit, oak, and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body-silky in texture at first, then becoming and firm. On the palate, the whisky starts out gently sweet, with creamy vanilla and honeyed malt. Subtle tropical fruit notes arrive mid palate. The whisky then begins to dry out fairly rapidly (this is a 36 year old Lowland after all), as dry resinous notes of vanilla, mint, and herbs reveal themselves. The whisky finishes dry, with notes of soft leather. The way the owners of Auchentoshan and Glen Garioch are handling vintage bottlings now is that specialty retailer orders an entire cask and sells it exclusively. This one is a Sam's exclusive. It's older than the previous, widely distributed 1966 bottling and less expensive too! You wouldn't expect a triple distilled Lowland whisky to age so gracefully. Auchentoshan is an exception to the rule. It has acquired the depth and maturity from extensive aging, yet it still manages to maintain its distillery character and Lowland gentility. Only on the dry finish does it really show its age. But that's a small price to pay for an otherwise very good single cask whisky at a very reasonable price for 36 years old.",120.0,90,49.4,1.0
986,Gavin Smith,"This single cask bottling was distilled in December 1995 and matured in a refill hogshead (#258). Warm, sweet biscuit notes on the nose, plus almonds and tangerines. Substantial on the palate, with vanilla fudge and Jaffa orange. Softly spicy, with developing licorice. Long in the finish, with spicy licorice, plain chocolate, and light tannins. (258 bottles)",160.0,90,50.1,
988,Dominic Roskrow,"If every fan of sherried whisky has a favorite GlenDronach then this is a long way down the road to being mine. It has a dusty dried orange peel, powdery, and perfumey nose, a soft and sweet round palate with a dark chocolate, tangerine, and pink grapefruit heart, and a balanced and gentle finish. This was probably once a hollerin’ maned lion of a malt, but it’s grown old gracefully and it now purrs and growls beautifully. £80",125.0,90,57.9,
990,Lew Bryson,"Hot barrel wood, like opening a rickhouse in July; light allspice, vanilla, and fiery alcohol. Drinkable without water, surprisingly. Hot syrup, corn sugar caramel, tannic oak, and a bit of stickiness. An interesting look at Jack Daniel’s: unblended, undiluted, untamed. It’s still Jack—sweet, insistent—but it’s taller, bigger. I could say I’d like even more heft, more complexity…but would that be asking Jack to be something it simply is not?",65.0,90,65.85,2.0
992,Davin de Kergommeaux,"What a shame this whisky will sail to Taiwan with nary a bottle left for North America. It would be the oldest and most expensive Canadian whisky on the continent.

995,Gavin Smith,"The initial release in Glenglassaugh’s new ‘The Chosen Few’ range has been picked by customer accounts manager Ronnie Routledge. It was distilled in 1976 and matured in an ex-sherry butt that yielded 654 bottles. Initially, an aroma of Black Twist tobacco and treacle, with sweeter and more floral notes following on. Significant honey influence. Mouth-coating, with sweet sherry and tropical fruits, plus developing honey and spice notes. Oak, toast, and dark chocolate in the lingering, lively finish. £300",471.0,90,49.6,1.0
996,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Matured in bone-dry Alberta, where the angels quenched their thirst with water, not alcohol, and the strength steadily climbed over the 35 years spent in wood. Butterscotch, but no inkling of spirit, yet blistering heat on the palate. Surprisingly smooth, though your tongue simply glows. Water adds complexity: dry grain, fresh denim, dust, peaches, green apples, sweet woodiness, and a long blazing finish. Pretty spectacular. (Taiwan only) NT$22,310",684.0,90,79.9,4.0
997,John Hansell,"A special Balvenie to honor Master Distiller David Stewart’s 30 years working at the distillery. This is a big and brooding dram. The aroma suggests it is aged in both bourbon and sherry oak. It’s complex and richly flavored (sweeter up front and increasingly dry towards its finish), with notes of honey, candied fruit, thick cut marmalade, vanilla, almonds, and prominent spicy oak notes. I’m picking up plenty of sherry in this new expression, which I like. It finishes firmly dry, with notes of spice and tannin. While I enjoy this whisky a great deal, you might want to seek out the Balvenie 25 year old (which I rated a 93) while the odd bottle is still available. It is slightly more rounded on the palate, and less than half the cost.",550.0,90,47.3,1.0
999,Gavin Smith,"Swiss-based Chapter 7 released this 19 year old single malt, a marriage of two sherry butts (#796 and #1,476). Malt, sweet sherry, cocktail cherries, milky coffee, and a slightly earthy undertone on the nose. Very rich on the palate, with chewy-sweet soft fruits, notably strawberries, syrup sponge, and lively fruit spices. Mouth-drying in the long finish, with aniseed and wood spice. (1,076 bottles)",180.0,90,55.8,1.0
1000,John Hansell,"Yes, 23 years is a long time to age bourbon. And yes, there’s plenty of oak influence. But there’s an underlying sweetness that balances the oak spice (with this particular cask; others may vary). Chewy in texture, with toffee, dates, fig cake (with nuts), barrel char, tobacco, leather, and a dusting of cocoa.",200.0,90,45.0,2.0
1002,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Sometimes, when whisky is batched, a few leftover barrels are returned to the warehouse. Canadian Club recently pulled and vatted several of these from the 1970s. Acetone, Granny Smith apples, and fresh-cut white cedar showcase this long age. Complex and spicy, yet reserved, this dram is ripe with strawberries, canned pears, cloves, pepper, and faint flowers, then slightly pulling oak tannins. Distinct, elegant, and remarkably vibrant, this ancient Canadian Club is anything but tired. (Australia only) A$133",102.0,90,40.0,4.0
1005,Dave Broom,"Often overshadowed by other noisier neighbors, it is time to reconsider Caol Ila—and this is a fine place to start. Coming from a refill cask it has a nose of sweet crab, ham with cider glaze, and teasing maritime smoke. The palate mixes salt taffy with top-end peppery olive oil, allowing the flavors to cover the palate while the smoke rumbles along constantly before a salt-laden finish. Superlative balance. Find one of those 620 bottles! £85",133.0,90,60.4,1.0
1007,John Hansell,"Great balance between vibrant oak spice and lush, sherried fruit. Interwoven notes of honeyed malt, vanilla, citrus fruit, milk chocolate, and lingering peat add complexity. Quite large for a BenRiach and very fresh for its age. This whisky takes BenRiach to a higher level.",325.0,90,45.0,1.0
1009,John Hansell,"Beautifully clean and polished on the palate -- it still allows BenRiach’s other flavors to shine through. Ripe, complex tropical fruit notes meld with delicate honey and suggestions of shortbread cookies and toasted coconut. Teasing peat and smoke surfaces from time to time. This whisky is a lot of fun to drink. (800 bottles total; 120 for the U.S.)",400.0,90,55.5,1.0
1010,Gavin Smith,"This vintage expression from Jura has been matured in three first-fill bourbon casks and then finished for one year in a ruby port pipe. Just 498 bottles have been released. Apricots, pineapple, caramel, butterscotch, sultanas, and white chocolate on the nose. The palate is warm and spicy, with subtle pine and citrus fruits, along with coconut and a hint of peat. Long in the finish with more vanilla before dried fruits and oak kick in. The delicate peat remains.",900.0,90,46.0,1.0
1011,John Hansell,"Similar to the standard Forty Creek Barrel Select, whiskymaker John Hall produces three different whiskies (rye, corn, and malted barley), ages them separately, and then marries them for a period before bottling. Unlike the Barrel Select, with Double Barrel Reserve, the resultant whisky is married in first-fill bourbon barrels rather than sherry casks. The result is a rich vanilla creaminess that coats the palate. Mixed in, you’ll find coconut, marshmallow, citrus, and pineapple, with emerging toasted pecan, dried spice, and dusty corn on the finish. Quite soothing and dangerously drinkable. My favorite so far from the various Forty Creek releases.",60.0,90,40.0,4.0
1012,Lew Bryson,"This release is based on a mash done at Sierra Nevada brewery, aged in eight different types of casks (including apple brandy and white wine) running from 4 to 15 years old. Delicate fruit, nuts, and sweet malt combine like perfect pastry in the nose. Add a bit of unsweetened chocolate on the palate, finishing with a lingering reminiscence of every bit of flavor, and you have a beautifully integrated whiskey that is unmistakably St. George. Delightful.",80.0,90,43.0,3.0
1016,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Straight, 100% unmalted barley whiskey. This must be a first in modern times. The huge nose gushes unusual aromas of fresh-turned earth, wet corn cobs, sour green apples, anise, cilantro, and dill. An herbal nose becomes an herbal palate bathed in soft crème brûlée and hot, peppery spices. Earthy notes turn pleasantly musty, like damp straw. Finishes long on Scottish porridge. Like all Masterson’s, this barley whiskey is from Alberta Distillers. And yes, Canadian whiskey with an “e.”",79.0,90,50.0,4.0
1018,John Hansell,"The fruit (orange marmalade, tangerine, fresh pineapple) is nearly as dominant as the leafy smoke. Sweet notes of nutty caramel, honeyed barley, toffee, and nougat round out the palate. Ginger, cinnamon, telicherry pepper, tobacco, and ash play a supporting role. Lingering fruity, smoky finish. For those who like sherried Islay whiskies.",100.0,90,53.5,1.0
1020,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Innovation is key at Windsor’s Corby Distillers. Though best known for its Wiser’s range, Corby also makes this juicy new four-grain beauty. Big and firm on the palate, G&W glides into a buttery corn-whisky slather flooded with delicate rye flowers, nutty dusty barley, and soft, sweet wheat notes. Want the list? Crisp clean oak, citrus pith, stewed fruits, meadow flowers, and brisk pepper with mildly pulling tannins. (Canada only) C$45",34.0,90,44.4,4.0
1022,John Hansell,"Quite fragrant, with a thick, oily texture. Sweet notes (vanilla, sticky toffee), ripe barley, earthy peat, licorice root, and a hint of melon and citrus. Very clean and characterful. A lot of fun to drink. Nicely done! I can’t imagine a 14 year old Glen Garioch tasting any better than this. (A Julio’s Liquor Exclusive)",100.0,90,54.6,1.0
1023,Dave Broom,"Just pause for a moment before tasting. 50 years. What has happened in the world during that time? How have you changed? What has it done to the whisky? Added a quiet elegance. It brings to mind elements of long-dried concentrated fruit and nut, damson, even smoke. The tannins are initially dusty, but a splash of water adds a fresh potpourri perfume. Is it expensive? For something that’s spent 50 years in a cask? No, it isn’t. (937 bottles) £1800",2339.0,90,41.1,1.0
1024,Gavin Smith,"Swiss-based Chapter 7 released this 19 year old single malt, a marriage of two sherry butts (#796 and #1,476).

(1,076 bottles)",180.0,90,55.8,
1025,Gavin Smith,"Following on from 21 and 25 year old expressions of Authenticus, BenRiach has now added its oldest variant yet to the lineup. The nose offers orchard fruits, honey, polished oak, and vanilla-tinged peat smoke. Full and fruity on the palate, with sweet peat having a presence, plus milk chocolate and licorice. The finish is relatively long, with citrus fruit, ashy smoke, and a lingering herbal note. £400; Not available in the U.S.",555.0,90,46.0,1.0
1026,Gavin Smith,"This expression of The Dalmore Constellation spent its entire 33 years of maturation in an ex-bourbon cask, with no additional finishing. The result is a nose of ripe peaches and pears, honey, and vanilla. Full-bodied, rich, sweet, elegant, yet substantial on the palate, with pineapples and fudge. Oak and aniseed slowly build, but the wood is held at bay. Long and warming in the finish, with soft spices. Barely drying. Cask number 594; 199 bottles.",,90,48.5,1.0
1028,Dave Broom,"It’s been quite a year for Lagavulin; a 25 year old is due (but no sample at the time of writing). This was a 6,000-strong bottling, aged in refill hoggies and ‘bodega’ butts. Initially restrained and mildly oxidized, it shows angelica, a spritz of lemon juice on potted shrimp, then fennel pollen and water mint. The smoke is pulled back. The palate has orchard fruits, creosote, and moss. Lagavulin’s top notes accentuated, but with the depth of age. £125",162.0,90,49.5,1.0
1029,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Crown Royal develops its bourbon-like house style by using an American-style mashbill of 64% corn, 31.5% rye, and 4.5% malted barley for one of its many component whiskies. From this single component, blender Mark Balkenende selected mature whisky exhibiting sweet flowers, pear juice, vanilla, fresh grain, mild barrel tones, clean dry wood, brisk spices, and a long, glowing finish. Very floral, fruity, and quaffable. ($55CAD; Ontario only)",42.0,90,45.0,4.0
1031,John Hansell,"The oldest Ardmore I have tasted. Smartly bottled at cask strength and not chill-filtered. (The entry level Ardmore “Traditional” is at the opposite end of the age spectrum, tasting quite youthful.) My initial concern with this 30 year old was: would the wood dominate the lovely floral, smoky notes I enjoy so much with Ardmore? The wood is certainly present, but the smoke still comes through. There’s a gently layered sweetness that complements the smoke (toffee, deep caramel, subtle honey), licorice root, bourbon barrel char, coffee grounds, and high cocoa chocolate, with subtle dried citrus and a suggestion of floral soap. Dry finish, with more bourbon barrel char and licorice root. Considering that Ardmore has historically been a blending malt, most of the stocks right now are much younger. This is a rare treat. It’s a wee bit thin in body and a little on the dry side from 30 years on wood for me to rate it in the mid 90s, but it’s still a very enjoyable whisky.",450.0,90,53.7,1.0
1032,John Hansell,"This is not a single-cask bottling like other recent wine-finished releases, but the casks they selected are very good ones. Lovely antique amber color. The Madeira dovetails beautifully with the malt and oak, and it has matured nicely for a whisky less than ten years old. Lush notes of orange marmalade, raspberry tart, and panforte, all wrapped up in rich toffee and a dusting of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cocoa. A dry, resinous, spicy, tactile finish adds balance, complexity, and additional dimension. Smartly bottled at a higher strength. Some of these wine-finished Arran whiskies are impressive. This is one of them.",75.0,90,50.0,1.0
1033,Dave Broom,"Although the youngest of the range, this has still spent 24 years in a refill butt.  The nose is highly concentrated, with freshly-sharpened pencils and black cherry. There’s also some tobacco and then an earthy, armagnac-esque pruniness. Water brings out a resinous element, supple leather, and fruit syrups, allowing it to retain complexity. The driest of the range with the most obvious grip; for lovers of big, sherried, malts. £225",379.0,90,51.4,1.0
1038,John Hansell,"A harmonious marriage of fruit and spice. More balanced than last year’s sweet Rum Cask release. In fact, this is one of the most deftly-balanced whiskies I’ve tasted this year. Bramble, ripe nectarine, caramel apple, honeyed vanilla, and golden raisin, spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft (for Balvenie), lingering, warm, dried spice finish.",120.0,90,43.0,1.0
1040,John Hansell,"The first of Glenmorangie’s new “Private Collection” line of whiskies for Travel Retail. This one is finished in Pedro Ximenez (PX) sherry. With PX being so rich and intense, and Glenmorangie spirit so subtly complex and delicate, does the sherry dominate here? No, it doesn’t. Still, this is viscous and very textural for a Glenmorangie. I’m picking up rhum agricole drenched with honeyed apricot, toffee almond, chocolate-covered raisin, glazed citrus, and cherry pits, all leading to a leathery, tobacco-tinged finish. A visceral whisky with plenty of grip. Great for after dinner.",70.0,90,46.0,1.0
1042,Dave Broom,"Immediate rancio notes, with some hazelnut and cheese rind. Added oxidative notes of nuts moves things into Brandy de Jerez territory. Sumptuous stuff, with Miltonduff’s floral character adding a delicate top note, something which is enhanced with water. The tannins are light, allowing a silky feel to predominate, with just enough of a bitter edge to add interest. Very good indeed. £81",127.0,90,51.5,1.0
1044,Dave Broom,"Weighty and deep. Instantly seductive: vanilla pod, rich fruits, the smell of fur coats. A femme fatale of a malt. A base of crisp malt mixes with oak to give balance and structure. Water brings out apple leaf, even a little grassiness. The palate is broad and balanced, with real sweetness and a tongue-coating quality which softens to dried fruit, earthy density, with a whiff of smoke. Redolent with the aroma of a dunnage warehouse. A class act.",99.0,90,43.0,1.0
1047,Gavin Smith,"Having replaced the 16 year old Longmorn with a no age statement Distiller’s Choice, owner Chivas Brothers reintroduced the16 year old. Vanilla, milk chocolate, and honey on the nose, plus quite intense sweet pear and apple notes. More rich fruit notes on the nicely textured palate, with vanilla and milk chocolate carrying over from the nose, plus raisins. The finish is long and silky smooth.",252.0,90,48.0,1.0
1048,Fred Minnick,"Rich and bold, it’s loaded with caramel notes that range from macchiato to salted caramel chews. Then complexity sets in, with brown sugar, vanilla cake batter, cinnamon-dusted molasses cookies, candied pecans, brown-sugar butter, and cornbread. The key here is that each note appears with that initial caramel richness and follows this to the long, warm, and satisfying finish with a hint of spice.",60.0,90,62.1,2.0
1049,John Hansell,"Deeper and darker than some Four Roses, but with plenty of bright, lush sweetness. Notes of toffee, honey-drenched nuts, and ripe summer fruit. Nicely spiced, with cinnamon, nutmeg, and a dusting of mocha. I just love the honey influence. A well-balanced whiskey, with all the flavors taking turns to shine. Great integration of flavors, too! One of my favorite Four Roses single barrel bourbons, which will grow on you with every sip.",80.0,90,58.0,2.0
1051,Gavin Smith,"This straddles the existing Sherry Oak and Fine Oak ranges by being a mix of spirit matured in both European and American oak sherry casks. Earthy sherry and old leather on the nose, with toffee, polished oak, and cherry blossom. Medium to full-bodied, with sherry, orange, cocoa, nutty vanilla, and developing wood spices on the honeyed palate. The finish is creamy, with insistent spices, cocoa, and tangy oak.",65.0,90,40.0,1.0
1052,Fred Minnick,"Cotton candy, marshmallows roasting over an open campfire, baked apples, and cornbread batter start a whiskey that then offers hints of caramel apples, pumpkin pie, and roasted pecans. Water opens it up to more nuanced fruit, spice, and sweetness. Without water, brown-sugar butter dominates about mid-palate and leads to a long finish. Dilution makes this a completely different whiskey experience.",45.0,90,58.4,2.0
1053,Dave Broom,"This Bowmore has been finished in sherry casks, but without allowing the exuberance of the cask to overwhelm the dram. Instead, there’s concentrated stone fruits, lifted smoke, dried mint, dark chocolate, bitter orange peels, and some smoke. There’s a teasing hint on the tongue of tropical fruits, then a deepening mix of plump dried figs and sultana. Long, layered, with the smoke seamlessly involved, adding accents rather than fogging up proceedings. (Whisky Shop chain only) £70",118.0,90,53.7,1.0
1054,Lew Bryson,"Dad’s Hat rye has evolved, like many craft whiskeys, but they’re still bottling at 6 to 9 months (another label is planned for a straight version). That’s working well. The nose is rip-roaring rye: crushed grain, grass, sweet spice, bitter herbal notes, with all the complexity of the grain. Delivers honestly on the tongue, too, plus a light barrel character, proceeding to an integrated finish. Excellent young rye, there’s no mistaking the mother grain.",39.0,90,45.0,3.0
1055,Gavin Smith,"This limited release was aged in seven cask types—both American and European oak in a variety of sizes—from four Spanish bodegas: Vasyma, Diego Martin, Jose Miguel Martin, and Tevasa. Citrus fruits, ginger, black pepper, light smoke, and rubbery leather on the nose. Ultimately, carnations. The palate is rich, nutty, and sweet, with malt, toffee, sticky sherry, maraschino cherries, milk chocolate, and gentle spice. Long in the finish, with spices and creamy cocoa.",105.0,90,48.2,1.0
1057,Gavin Smith,"This is the oldest core expression of Tomintoul’s Gentle Dram, now available in the U.S. It is a classic of this style of Speyside single malt. Peaches, malt, honey, vanilla, and developing floral notes on the nose. Full-bodied, with ripe apples, cocoa, milky coffee, honey, vanilla, and soft spices. Spicy and drying, with plain chocolate in the relatively lengthy, mellow finish.",415.0,90,43.0,1.0
1058,Gavin Smith,"A refill American oak hogshead matured this whisky. The nose offers malt, vanilla fudge, pineapple, and contrasting lemon. Lively tropical fruits on the palate, almonds, walnuts, and ginger cookies, with ever-present oak. Bitter coffee in the medium-length, leathery finish.",,90,43.8,
1059,John Hansell,"A lovely example of a mature, sherried Bowmore. Its rich flavors evolve on the palate and are nicely balanced. Lush fruit, juicy oak, damp peat, and kiln smoke are peppered with cinnamon, raisins, dates, and cocoa. Warming, soothing finish. Not quite Black Bowmore, but a delicious whisky nonetheless.",800.0,90,51.0,1.0
1061,John Hansell,"Darkest now has an age statement of 15 years old. This new release is an improvement from the original Darkest, both of which are succulently sherried. It is fuller in flavor and more visceral, in both the nose and palate. These differences are subtle, but positive. Notes of lush fruit, raisin, pot-still rum, and Heath bars. Citrus and wood spices emerge, along with burning peat embers that linger on the finish. Nicely done.",65.0,90,43.0,1.0
1062,Dave Broom,"The oldest of the set shows a shift into a sense of calm and quietude. The dried blossoms of youth are there, still with a little color to them, while a curl of smoke also comes through. Then, out of nowhere, a sudden eruption of tropical fruits, a flaring in the dying light. There’s no oakiness, just a distillery, framed, gently receding. A remarkable dram. It’s almost shameful to discuss cost! £19,000",,90,45.9,1.0
1063,John Hansell,"Antique amber color. Aromas of toffee and malt, with interwoven dried fruit, flowers, and spices-a real potpourri. Rich, lush body. Rich flavors of toffee, wood resin spices, and citrus, finishing with notes of malt, toffee, and a hint of leather and smoke.",180.0,90,42.7,1.0
1065,John Hansell,"The folks at Angel’s Envy once again push the envelope with this 95% rye whiskey finished in Caribbean rum casks. Vibrant, spicy rye notes (cinnamon and mint) are tamed by rich maple syrup, graham cracker crust, nutty toffee, candy floss, subtle tropical fruit, and creamy vanilla. Warm, spicy, rummy finish. This is a mood whiskey—not one I would drink every day—but the flavors marry nicely and the sweetness tames this high-testosterone rye whiskey. Bonus points for uniqueness. Editor's Choice",70.0,90,50.0,2.0
1066,John Hansell,"Very graceful, with a nice balance of youth and maturity. Gently sweet notes of toffee, fig, nougat, and maple syrup, spiked with cinnamon and vanilla. Dark berried fruit and a hint of coconut round out the palate. Perilously more-ish bourbon with a very easy-going demeanor. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",65.0,90,56.6,2.0
1067,Lew Bryson,"WHACK! The spicy smack of the nose sends me to check the mashbill; sure enough, this is 38% rye. The nose fumes with youthful zest: cinnamon, bright mint, sun-warmed green grass. Pour some on the palate for more explosive entertainment; sweet cinnamon red-hots burst, corn pops, and the oak burns on into the rye-high finish. This is one excitable boy of a bourbon, and it’s got me humming along. Impressive.",40.0,90,43.0,3.0
1068,Dave Broom,"The last official Convalmore remains one of my top whiskies. Here is a different meditation on age. There’s soft leather, coal smoke, and polished brass. The distillery’s waxiness is a spent candle in a deserted chapel, the harvest festival fruits wrinkling on the altar. Amazingly, in the mouth a shaft of honeyed sunlight comes through to transform the scene into one of life. Everything glows, the wax returns, and then, with the smoke increasing, the light fades. Old, and fascinating. (2,980 bottles)",936.0,90,58.0,1.0
1069,John Hansell,"A polished whisky, light-medium in body with well-rounded flavors. Fruity (ripe orange, lemon gumdrops, candy apple), with creamy vanilla and a honeyed, toasted malt foundation. Soft, gentle oak throughout. What a lovely, gentle-natured whisky, straight down the middle! Bonus points for versatility.",260.0,90,46.0,1.0
1071,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in December 2005 using malt peated to a whopping 167 parts per million, this was matured in a mix of bourbon and Grenache Blanc casks. Old warm leather, rich smoke, developing peaty peach, chocolate-coated toffee, pipe tobacco, and iodine on the powerful nose. Huge peatiness in the mouth, oily, smoky orchard fruits, developing ginger nuts, and sea salt. Warming in the finish, with licorice, gunpowder tea, and ashy peat.",235.0,90,57.3,1.0
1072,Gavin Smith,"This was matured in first-fill sherry, bourbon, French wine, and tempranillo casks. Initial brine on the nose gives way to malt and orchard fruits, sweet smoke, and buttery malt. Sweet, medicinal smoke notes on the early palate, then toffee and peaches drying to aniseed and chili. Long and prickly in the finish, with licorice and black pepper. A complex rendering of Port Charlotte.",70.0,90,50.0,1.0
1074,Dominic Roskrow,"Credit to Glengoyne for coming up with something different. There are just 100 bottles of this malt available this year, with a further 100 or so released each Christmas from the same cask each year until 2014, effectively offering malt enthusiasts the chance to plot a work in progress. Better still, this first effort is one of the best releases ever to come out of the distillery.
The name is spot on; it really is Christmas in a glass, with the almost feminine aromas of rosewater, flowers, candy stick, and fruit giving way to a huge sherry note on the palate. Dark chocolate, cherry, orange, and chili notes combine to offer up a bold and full malt. Some special bottlings from Glengoyne have been over-oaky or marred by sulfur, but not this one. This is clean, pure, and classy. Can’t wait to see where it goes next.",155.0,90,60.6,1.0
1076,Dominic Roskrow,"This is like a blast from the past, with much in common with the sherried Cask Strength of old, and a welcome treat for any fan of the big, sherried Macallans. All the red berry and blood orange notes are present on the nose, along with cocoa and a dusty smokiness. The palate is full, velvety and chewy, with Christmas cake, oranges, and some nuttiness. Nutmeg and cinnamon fill out the mouth feel, before a long and classic sherried finish.",185.0,90,52.3,1.0
1077,Dave Broom,"A (very) special anniversary bottling, this is old-style, brooding Laphroaig. Fully mature and rich, it shows that classic roiling mass of kelp, oil, and brine, always balanced by sweetness: in this case autumn berry fruits. Malt adds a crunchiness. The palate is gentle and slow with the characteristic camphoraceous lift of bog myrtle on the back palate, which is all that remains of the smoke. Pricey, yes, but rare. Get saving!",,90,46.5,1.0
1078,Gavin Smith,"The latest addition to Glengoyne’s permanent range is a 25 year old, matured in European oak sherry casks and presented in non-chill filtered format. Syrup-like on the nose, very sweet, with milk chocolate, ginger, Jaffa oranges, and sticky toffee pudding. Smooth and sweet on the palate, with overt sherry, sultanas, and gentle spice.

The two batches are then reunited in bourbon barrels before a final finishing in tawny port pipes.

1084,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The standard Gooderham & Worts blends corn, wheat, barley, and rye whiskies. This special edition forgoes the barley but not the flavor. A lovely hard toffee start slides into a wealth of cereal notes: barley sugars, Cream of Wheat, and oatmeal. Lovely soft caramels send a smooth sweetness gliding over the palate. Little Trinity exemplifies luxurious mouthfeel as much as it does breadth of flavor.",80.0,90,45.0,4.0
1086,Dave Broom,"For me, Talisker 30 year olds have paled in comparison to the same distillery’s 20 and 25 year olds. This, however, immediately shows promise. Gold in color, and while it’s another one that starts ever so slightly restrained, the giveaway peppery note soon reveals itself as smoked pimento and Szechuan pepper, mixed with extra virgin olive oil spread over hot smoked salmon. There’s also a touch of putty — something which you usually only see in youthful expressions — suggesting that here’s another refill maturation. 
As with many of these older whiskies, water isn’t the best option for the palate, but a drop does help release the sweet fruitiness that always lurks in Talisker’s heart, this time accompanied by an herbal note (mint and fennel). It’s almost as if it is looking back at itself as an 18 year old, but here the firm granitic grip of age takes hold.
The palate starts slowly but opens well with a gentle, yet assertive revealing of the aromas on the nose. It seems to dip in energy just in the center before sparking back to life when the smoke emerges, like the last flash of defiance from an old-timer.",349.0,90,57.3,1.0
1087,Gavin Smith,"Fire is the first Highland Park expression to be fully matured in “refill port wine-seasoned casks” and it carries a 15 year age statement. Very fruity on the nose—raspberries and prunes —plus lightly-smoked pineapple and vanilla. More smoky, spicy fruit features on the palate, with a light sprinkling of cinnamon. The peat dries to leave ashy licorice and black pepper in a lingering finish. The port is pleasingly discreet. (4,938 bottles for the U.S.)",300.0,90,45.2,1.0
1088,John Hansell,"Finished in Chateau d’Yquem casks, and it shows. There’s a creamy, honeyed sweetness and viscosity to this whisky that is very soothing. Bruichladdich’s brisk sea character cuts through the lightly syrup-like thickness and keeps the whisky fresh and lively, while notes of golden raisin, peaches, lemon gum drops, vanilla, and coconut add complexity. Satisfying salty/sweet finish.",80.0,90,46.0,1.0
1089,John Hansell,"A marriage of Bruichladdich with three different peating levels. Devotees of young, smoky Islay whiskies will enjoy this one. It is youthful and explosive, with earthy peat smoke, fish nets, brine, and kiln ash. All this is tamed beautifully by notes of vanilla wafer, seductive malt, marshmallow, spiced peaches, and pear.",65.0,90,50.0,1.0
1091,John Hansell,"This one is my favorite of the four distillery-bottled Bruichladdich whiskies reviewed here. It still quite lively and nicely balanced for such a mature whisky (and reminiscent of the previous 1970 vintage in this respect), with some floral notes and brine emerging from its fruity, vanilla, truffle, nougat foundation. Still, it maintains an air of lightness and freshness throughout, with a pleasingly dry, subtly spicy finish that lingers.",285.0,90,,1.0
1092,Dave Broom,"Deep amber. Big, resinous, and almost heathery, with significant cask influence for a decade-old dram. The aroma is like a cobbler’s workshop: oils, leather, grease, polish, and then licorice. On the palate, there’s the prune notes of armagnac, the sweetness and cedar flavors of old rum, and very Rothes-esque spiciness. Water, just a drop, lightens it a little, allowing the underlying sweetness to show. Not cask dominated, just bottled at exactly the right moment. Recommended. £68",104.0,90,46.0,1.0
1093,John Hansell,"An unusual, but very fine, Bruichladdich, with sweet, chewy toffee notes I often associate with Speyside whiskies, not Islay (although I have tasted a few older Bunnahabhain whiskies that were like this). Layers of marzipan and chocolate fudge also emerge, and I even pick up some apple and black cherry fruit in the background. Bruichladdich's ""sea breeze"" freshness rises through the chewy sweetness and provides balance and complexity.",234.0,90,46.0,1.0
1094,John Hansell,"Aged, then finished, in Bowman barrels that held Hardywood Park brewery gingerbread stout in between. A beautifully spicy bourbon—but not aggressively so—with cinnamon, clove, and nutmeg. The spice is presented on a bed of layered sweetness (vanilla, caramel, and soft maple syrup), rounded out by subtle candied fruit and nuts. Nicely rounded, fun and easy to drink. One of my favorites so far from Bowman.",70.0,90,45.0,
1095,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Recently, Crown Royal began bottling some of the 50-odd whiskies in its core blend. Hand Selected Barrel and Northern Harvest Rye each peeked behind the blenders’ curtain. Now Blenders’ Mash (originally called Bourbon Mash) unveils the woody vanilla signature of Canada’s bestseller. This approachable, creamy, medium-bodied whisky bathes in sweet vanilla and mild oak tannins, seasoned with peppery spices and fruity-floral esters. Incredibly long, creamy, vanilla finish.",28.0,89,40.0,4.0
1096,John Hansell,"Created by distiller John Hall to celebrate his fifteen years of making whisky. It really is a whisky that defies categorizing. More body than most Canadian whiskies; softer and less aggressive than bourbon. When compared to Forty Creek Barrel Select (John’s standard whisky), it’s richer, more velvety, and sweeter on the nose and palate. Notes of toffee, silky caramel, mixed nuts, exotic spice, and a hint of marmalade. A soothing, almost rummy, very drinkable whisky.",60.0,89,40.0,
1097,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A new direction for Forty Creek’s 8th annual release, which was aged 3 years, redistilled, then aged another 9 years. Quintessentially Canadian, it begins with Caramac candy bar, finishing in white pepper and bitter grapefruit pith. Not as lush as past releases, although the flavors remain a tightly woven panoply of fruit, spices, vegetal notes, and citrus zest. Gooseberries and lime on the nose become black currants on the palate as increasing hints of red wine come to dominate.",70.0,89,43.0,4.0
1098,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Celebrating its 25th anniversary this year, Glenora distillery has certainly hit its stride. This clean, grassy 21 year old tastes like nothing so much as a top Speyside scotch. Fresh hay notes and a slightly effervescent spiciness give the feel, but not the taste, of hot black licorice. Barrel notes begin to show in the middle, resolving into a long, peppery, pithy finish. Barrel selected by Mike Brisebois for Casker’s whisky club. Good stuff, Glenora! (Distillery only)",300.0,89,43.0,4.0
1109,John Hansell,"A “wheated” bourbon, meaning that it doesn’t have the spicy rye notes found in a more traditional “ryed” bourbon. A pleasantly sweet, easy-going, well-balanced experience. Creamy vanilla, caramel, candied corn, and ripe berried fruit , along with more subtle notes of glazed orange, cocoa powder, and wood shavings. If I were going to ease a new bourbon drinker into the category, I might pick this one. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot).",22.0,89,45.0,2.0

1111,John Hansell,"Richly textured -- almost chewy -- with toffee, molasses, nougat, date, candy corn, ripe clementine, and raisin, peppered with dusty grain, cocoa powder, moss, Play-Doh, subtle mint, and herbs. Not as crisp or clean on the palate as the Wild Turkey American Spirit 15 year old, released a couple years ago (which I rated a 94), but it is still very good and rather therapeutic in nature. It makes for a nice digestif. This is a different style of Wild Turkey. There’s a good deal of wood influence. I suspect that some will like this a lot, while others might not warm up to it as much. It took a few encounters for me to embrace it.",100.0,89,50.5,2.0
1112,John Hansell,"A marriage of 13 to 16 year old bourbons honoring master distiller Jimmy Russell’s 60 years at Wild Turkey. It is a more conservative Turkey compared to many of the previous limited-edition releases. But still, this is pleasant, with caramel and creamy vanilla intertwined with soft candied orange, cinnamon, polished oak, and a hint of evergreen. Nicely balanced, very approachable, but I would have preferred this at their signature 101 proof for added intensity.",125.0,89,45.5,2.0
1113,Fred Minnick,"An 8 year old from Wild Turkey’s Warehouse G, it’s classic Turkey on the nose, with a little spice, caramel, nutmeg, oak, and slight hints of lavender. Then sautéed barley, pecan shell, brown sugar, chewing tobacco, and bittersweet chocolate. An earthy oak note blossoms, with a layered caramel chew following this whiskey home to a medium finish. (Maisano’s Fine Wine and Spirits exclusive)",54.0,89,50.5,2.0
1114,John Hansell,"Keeping in the Weller tradition, this one is a wheated bourbon. Some wheated bourbons, although easy to drink, can taste a bit too sweet without the spicy rye notes in there. The better ones are often aged a little longer and/or bottled at higher strengths, where the wood and alcohol accompany the sweetness. You’ll find soothingly rich toffee, caramel fudge, dates, and nougat brightened up by berried fruit, and a hint of dusty corn. Gently sweet finish.",48.0,89,61.0,2.0
1115,Fred Minnick,"The same mashbill as its sister brand Old Forester, Woodford Reserve is an unknown combination from Brown-Forman’s Louisville and Versailles distilleries. There’s no age statement, but Woodford is around 7 years old. The key here is balance. One note never overtakes the other; nutmeg, mango, baked apples, cinnamon, blueberry pie, and vanilla seem to walk in perfect harmony. Then we find the gingerbread, caramel, and vanilla jumping into layers of smoke and spice.",35.0,89,45.2,2.0
1116,Fred Minnick,"Toasted oak, coffee, cola, molasses, and campfire smoke linger over a French bakery and baking spices that are both interesting and appealing.

Almond butter appears for the long finish.(Bottled in winter 2017; Kentucky only)",,89,45.2,
1117,Fred Minnick,"A bourbon made with cherrywood-smoked barley in the mash. When chocolate and cherries meet, instant joy can only be improved with roasted nuts sprinkled on top. That’s what happens here.

1124,Fred Minnick,"At first it’s a confectionery delight, with notes of cotton candy, caramel, burnt brown sugar, and praline. Then a spice explosion hits as the caramel becomes more defined. We’re talking pumpkin pie spice with hints of allspice, cardamom, and clove. Tobacco and stone fruit develop toward the end. Alas, its medium finish, with a hint of oak, doesn’t continue the complexity found on the palate.",90.0,89,45.0,2.0
1125,John Hansell,"Amber chestnut color. Rich, sweet aromas of toffee, maple syrup, soft candied fruit, and molasses, balanced by an oaky dryness and subtle spice notes. Thicker and fuller in body than previous vintages, with a somewhat silky texture. On the palate, the whiskey begins smooth and sweet, with notes of maple syrup, toffee, and soft ripe fruit, gradually increasing in intensity as spice (vanilla, subtle mint) and oak notes kick in. Lengthy finish.",25.0,89,45.0,2.0
1126,John Hansell,"This is an elegant whiskey with lots of finesse. Its primary flavors are vanilla, mint, and candied fruit. A touch of honey, light toffee, slight nuttiness, and rum notes round out the palate. Very clean, with a pleasingly dry finish. And nicely rounded too! Each year’s vintage is slightly different. Some have been quite rich and full in texture. This one is more subtle and teasing-and it’s one of the better ones.",25.0,89,,2.0
1127,John Hansell,"While last year’s vintage was a more delicate expression of Evan Williams, I loved it for its elegance, charm, and balance (and gave it a 95 rating). This one is darker in flavor and bolder, with more caramelized sugars (caramel, toffee, maple syrup) along with some underlying fruit. It’s also drier, spicier, and with more wood influence (resin and polished leather). It still maintains its balance on the nose and majority of the palate, but with more wood on the finish than I would prefer to rate it in the 90s. (One more thing to consider: it’s a single barrel bottling and no two barrels are alike.)(Value Pick)",26.0,89,43.3,2.0
1128,John Hansell,"Very straightforward and unassuming. Its greatest assets are its balance and drinkability, rather than its flavors. Lovely sweet notes (caramel, vanilla), orchard fruit, golden raisin, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, dusting of cocoa), leading to a smooth finish. Not the most distinctive or complex of the single barrel releases, but just a joy to drink. In fact, this is almost too drinkable. It’s a whiskey I feel would show better at a higher strength (say, 45% or even 50%).",26.0,89,43.3,2.0
1129,John Hansell,"Silky in texture and gently sweet. This new “Mariage Collection” release shows a softer, more elegant side of Four Roses when compared to their other bottlings (including the most recent limited edition 120th Anniversary bottling, which was a much bolder affair). Notes of candied fruit, black raspberry, blueberry, creamy vanilla, cornbread, and chamomile tea. Delicately spicy too, with a polished oak finish. Clean on the palate and very drinkable. Four Roses utilizes a wide variety of mash bills and yeast strains, and has the ability to produce a diverse array of whiskeys. This “Mariage” offering is a good example.",70.0,89,55.7,2.0
1130,John Hansell,"The replacement to Four Roses “Mariage” limited editions, which were a marriage of two different whiskey formulas. This new whiskey contains three of Four Roses’ ten different recipes. It tastes older and more mature than the standard Small Batch bottling—there’s a lot more oak dryness and spice, especially on the finish. Along with the oak, there’s plenty of fruit, too (citrus, pineapple, apricot, papaya), plus caramel-coated nuts, a kiss of honeyed vanilla, and complex dried spice (cocoa, nutmeg, cinnamon) kicking in on the finish. (Available September, 2010.)",75.0,89,55.05,2.0
1131,John Hansell,"The most brooding of the three. Not as polished as the Barrel Select, but certainly very entertaining. Shows more depth that the No. 8, with more dry oak intensity and more heft.

1132,John Hansell,"The oldest of the four in years, and also the highest in alcohol. It has managed to maintain its balance of flavors and keep the oak notes from becoming too dominant.

1134,Fred Minnick,"A beautiful opening of oak, butterscotch, and fruit quickly becomes more pronounced in banana and pineapple. Then baked apple, Bananas Foster, caramel pudding, and salt water taffy. Hints of smoke and paprika lurk, but marzipan and orange blossom honey nail the landing. The finish doesn’t hold up to the palate, only offering a hint of caramel. Very good, but not quite outstanding.",80.0,89,48.0,2.0
1136,Fred Minnick,"When spice meets fruit in whiskey, it’s a beautiful thing. Here, chili pepper melds with banana and pear, then baking spices tumble into passion fruit.

1139,John Hansell,"Identifiably richer, fuller, and smokier on the nose when compared to other young Ardbegs. While still prominent, there’s slightly less brine and seaweed, more earthiness, tar, soot, espresso, tobacco, grass, and chocolate fudge. The same goes for the palate. It starts out like a “slightly more gutsy than normal” cask strength, young Ardbeg (e.g., Renaissance) and, if you go into this experience expecting to be totally blown away by peat, tar, and smoke, you might feel a bit under-challenged initially. But the peat eventually builds to a powerful, lava-like crescendo and you realize that this is no ordinary Ardbeg. The length of the finish is seemingly endless; bold and warming. Through all this, there’s a soft underbelly of ripe barley and a vanilla sweetness to balance at least some of the tar, heat, and smoke -- something I admire in many Ardbegs. Bottom line: It’s an interesting, entertaining, and eye-opening experience. I like how mature it tastes for a relatively young whisky. But, like a whisky that shows just a bit too much sherry or oak, I think the extra peat, to a degree, masks the subtle complexities I admire in some other, lesser-peated Ardbegs, which is the only thing keeping me from scoring this whisky in the 90s. All smoky whisky enthusiasts should endeavor to try this at least once.",130.0,89,58.9,1.0
1140,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. Very bold aroma of toffee, dark chocolate, diesel fuel-soaked soil, smoldering campfire, coal tar, clove, leather, fig, and dark berried fruit. More of the same on the palate, with seaweed, smoked haddock, and cough drops emerging towards the finish. This whisky is very dynamic and exciting to drink. My only criticism: it comes across a little green on the finish, which keeps me from scoring it in the 90s. Still, it’s pretty impressive considering how young some of the whiskies in it are.

1141,Dave Broom,"Let it be known that from now on, June 2nd will be Ardbeg Day. That’s fine by me, as annually we can enjoy delights such as this bold expression that belts you in the nose with coal tar and soot before bay rum emerges, lightening slightly into lime and hot green bracken. The palate is oily, sweet, and very deep. A growly bugger that lurches toward the shore and then spins back to the laurel bushes inland. 13,000 bottles.",90.0,89,56.7,1.0
1142,Dave Broom,"A touch of damp dunnage, some Ardbeggian soot, and plenty of jalapeño-style heat. Shows maturity and depth of character, with just-dead bonfire, ointment, and a sweetness, which here is like honeycomb.

1143,Dave Broom,"Not an unpeated Ardbeg, but a new initiative to raise money for the Kildalton Project which supports community projects in south Islay. Smoke, but also real sweetness: hothouse peaches, mezcal, smoked oyster, sphagnum moss, a huge hit of vetiver, and coal tar. The smoke flies to the throat before fogging forward, while the sweet core (with added raspberry and cream, and mint) moves to the back. A worthwhile dram and a hugely worthwhile cause.

The tarry, peat smoke and bacon-like notes are a delight, and they are balanced nicely by a honey and apple pie sweetness. Spanish olives in brine, dark chocolate, golden raisin, and subtle spice round out the palate nicely. Not a heavy whisky, but pretty powerful stuff for BenRiach. So nice of the previous owners of this distillery to experiment with higher peating levels decades ago.",170.0,89,46.0,

The peatiness manifests itself as a smoky herbal note and shows most on the palate, but is never too dominant. An oil of clove coolness takes control on the finish. Great balance and integration; a finish that genuinely works. £53",87.0,89,50.0,1.0
1160,Dave Broom,"Remember those remarkable 20+ year old BenRiachs that appeared when the distillery reopened which we thought were gone forever? Think again. This new and keenly priced arrival has sweet malt on the nose, followed by mango, orange blossom honey, and Portuguese custard tarts. It needs a little water to calm the alcohol and help to spread an already thick texture along the tongue. A sweetly spicy and creamy hit toward the end. Marked within its competitive set. £60",86.0,89,57.2,1.0
1161,Gavin Smith,"This limited edition bottling is non-chill filtered and initially matured in bourbon barrels before an unspecified period of finishing in sweet Moscatel fortified wine casks from Spain and Portugal. Sweet grapes, dates, cinnamon, salted butter, wax polish, and printer’s ink on the nose. Viscous on the palate, with ripe plums, honey, plain chocolate, white pepper, and worn leather. The finish is long and fruity, with drying oak.",180.0,89,46.0,1.0
1162,Gavin Smith,"BenRiach’s latest release was matured in a combination of four diverse cask types: bourbon, virgin oak, Pedro Ximénez sherry, and red wine. The nose offers tangerines, milk chocolate, and spicy vanilla. Peaches, Brazil nuts, raisins, dates, and more chocolate on the palate, with red berries in the background. The finish is medium in length, with cocoa powder and ginger. £125; Not available in the U.S.",174.0,89,46.0,1.0
1163,Gavin Smith,"This includes whisky distilled in 2006, 2007, and 2008, and matured in a mixture of bourbon, oloroso, and virgin oak casks. Honey, apple blossom, ginger, and nutmeg on the nose, which then exhibits damp tweed, and finally, hot butter. Sweet on the full palate, with milk chocolate, honey, ripe peaches, almonds, vanilla, and caramel. Quite long in the finish, with zesty apple notes.",95.0,89,60.6,1.0
1164,John Hansell,"Subtle elegance, creamy, and extremely drinkable. Mouthwatering fruity notes (lemon, lime, tangerine, passion fruit) marry well with notes of fresh-cut grass, vanilla, and honey. Very clean too and nicely balanced! When I drink a Lowland whisky this good, I am saddened by all of the Lowland distilleries that have gone silent over the past 25 years, knowing what we have lost.",70.0,89,46.0,1.0
1165,John Hansell,"Amber-gold color. Exotic tropical fruit aromas (citrus, melon, coconut), with interwoven notes of almonds, pear, honey, and subtle peat smoke. Light to medium in body, and very delicate in nature. On the palate, the whisky begins sweet (especially honey), followed by a basket of exotic fruit and nuts similar to its aroma, becoming drier and distantly smoky on the finish. This Bowmore Fino Cask, a whisky which has aged very well indeed, is the first of three limited edition 1964 vintage Bowmore whiskies to be released over the next year. The two to follow in 2003 have been aged in bourbon oak and oloros sherry casks.",,89,49.4,1.0
1166,John Hansell,"Copper color with shades of ruby. Intriguing aromas of sweet plum, grapes, citrus, peat smoke, seaweed, and brine. Full-bodied and somewhat viscous. Flavors of ripe fruit (plums, grapes, citrus), followed by a burst of more traditional Bowmore flavors (peat smoke, brine, seaweed), finishing with lingering notes of prunes, dates, baker’s chocolate, and licorice.

While there is no age statement, this whisky was aged for 12 years in bourbon barrels, followed by an additional 18 months in ruby port casks. I believe it is the first distillery bottling to marry port with the traditional flavors of an Islay whisky. Because of this, it is best to keep an open mind when trying this whisky, perhaps even having more than one go at it before rendering a verdict. I suspect the more you try Voyage, the more you will like.",120.0,89,56.0,1.0
1167,John Hansell,"Amber with orange and ruby hues. Aromas of Islay peat smoke, wine fruit, and background floral and spice notes. Flavors reveal more of what the aroma suggests-peat smoke, fruit, and floral/spice notes-with a balancing oak and subtle sea salt and seaweed. The peat smoke particularly comes in on the finish, lest one forgets where Bowmore hails from. 
   Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: approx. $90. Availability: only 480 bottles for the entire United States, with the remainder of the 12,000 bottles going to Duty Free. 
   There is no age statement on the label, but this whisky has been aged for 12 years in traditional bourbon and sherry barrels, and then finished off for 18 months in Bordeaux (Claret) wine casks. The wine fruit certainly is evident and, like the Glenmorangie Claret Wood Finish offered a year or so ago, will appeal to those with an open mind and willingness to accept new flavors in whisky. Purists will say it detracts from the distillery's character. I believe it's the first smoky whisky that attempts to marry these flavors with claret fruitiness.",90.0,89,,1.0
1168,John Hansell,"Amber color. Aromas of peat smoke (but more subdued than many Bowmore whiskies in their teens), toasted oak, citrus fruit, vanilla, and a hint of the sea. Its flavors are similar, which express themselves in a very mature manner-oak flavors are more dominant than other components. Still, there is an emerging brine freshness that keeps the whisky from becoming tired and dull. Good, lengthy finish. 
Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: approx. $160. Availability: only 244 bottles total.",160.0,89,50.5,1.0
1169,John Hansell,"Antique gold color. Aromas of peat smoke, damp earth, exotic pepper, vanilla, and fruit. Medium body. A great balance of flavors, with a lovely Islay character. The whisky begins sweet up front, ultimately turning pleasingly dry towards the finish. In between you'll enjoy flavors of peat smoke, vanilla, spicy pepper, and delicately honeyed malt, with just a hint of the sea. What I like most about this whisky is its impeccable balance-between youth and maturity, sweetness and dryness-with just the right amount of peat smoke to declare its Islay roots without smothering its other flavors.",125.0,89,,1.0
1170,Dave Broom,"A very solid and sound Bowmore with saline notes, some dried hot pepper, and masses of menthol, which give a buzzy, nose-cleaning effect. The smoke gently glides along throughout. The palate is quite thick and shows sweetness and a slow release of soft fruit, with a tingle of salt. The smoke slowly increases until it concentrates on the back palate, giving an effect like burning pine logs on the beach. Becomes nicely funky in time. Recommended. £115",180.0,89,57.2,1.0
1171,John Hansell,"An excellent example of a younger Bruichladdich, and an interesting contrast to the Duncan Taylor expression reviewed above. Appetizing and very clean with a creamy texture. Honey and vanilla notes accentuate a fresh maltiness, with underlying marshmallow, grass and hay. The whisky finishes nicely rounded, pleasingly dry and salty, with a hint of seaweed. A great aperitif.",110.0,89,58.1,1.0
1172,Dave Broom,"A mélange of casks and techniques that only Jim McEwan knows about. The fourth iteration of his Black Art manages to mix mature notes of beeswax-burnished church pews, a sprinkling of rose water, dried mango, rosehip syrup, and potpourri. The palate opens to Parma violets, underpinned with light lavender, where fleshiness mingles with the exotic notes of manuka honey, pomegranate, apricot pits, and dried lemon. It pushes malt into a new area, but that’s the point. £200",322.0,89,49.2,1.0
1173,Dave Broom,"Bere is an ancient strain of barley which is stubbornly difficult to grow and mash. For this, Bruichladdich has gone to a specialist farm on Orkney. The nose is intriguingly aromatic, sweet and slightly corn-like, with a sweet nuttiness behind. It becomes very floral (night-scented stocks) with white currant, lemon sherbet, and a lift of tangerine before water brings out sakura (cherry blossom) syrup and bread. The palate is very sweet and concentrated. Remarkable. Keep watching. £52",83.0,89,50.0,1.0
1174,Gavin Smith,"Matured in first-fill sherry, bourbon, and French wine casks. Clean and fresh on the early nose; crisp green apples, vanilla, and floral notes, with just a hint of maritime influence in the background. Smooth on the palate, with spicy pear, honey, and ripe peaches; soon quite drying. The floral finish lingers, with spicy honey, drying spices, and ultimately a hint of smoke. (18,000 bottles)",66.0,89,50.0,1.0
1175,John Hansell,"There have been several lovely older expressions of Bunnahabhain over the past decade, and this is one of them. The vanilla cream and toffee nuttiness is balanced perfectly by polished oak, bright fruit (apricot, sultana, cherry pits), and subtle anise. There’s a calming quality to this whisky that is very more-ish. All the maturity of an older whisky without the tired, dominating oak.",420.0,89,40.5,1.0
1176,John Hansell,"The new version, at a higher proof and not chill-filtered. That helped — especially on the palate — with greater texture and more well-defined flavors. But the flavors are essentially the same: nutty, toffee, light molasses, vanilla fudge, with delicate fruit (citrus, dark berries) and a hint of brine. Very comforting. Extra points for versatility — this whisky will accommodate many moods and situations.",53.0,89,,1.0
1177,John Hansell,"Fresh and quite aromatic. Nice interplay between soothing malty sweetness and honest “naked” Caol Ila notes (in the sense that all the classic Caol Ila flavors are exposed-leafy smoke, tarry rope, salt & pepper spice, seaweed, and olive). An evolving whisky, with a phenolic, briny crescendo that lingers. Nicely done.",75.0,89,43.0,1.0
1178,John Hansell,"Pale gold color. Aromas and flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, lemon grass, olives, and green peppercorns. Medium bodied, and slightly oily in texture. Long, dry peat smoke finish. Caol Ila is an Islay dram that Laphroaig, Lagavulin, and Bowmore fans must become acquainted with. Although distllery bottlings are not available here in the U.S., many independent bottlers offer it. This expression is young, vibrant, and exciting.",45.0,89,43.0,
1179,John Hansell,"Finished in cognac wood. The cognac wood influence might dominate other whiskies, but the Coal Ila is big enough for challenge. If anything, it seems to contribute a silky elegance to what would otherwise be a brooding, bare-knuckled whisky;. It works nicely. Notes of germinating barley, vanilla cream, grape preserve, and peat bonfire, with a salty, smoky finish. (Available in the Chicago area.)",75.0,89,46.0,1.0
1180,John Hansell,"Soft and gentle (for Caol Ila, that is), thanks to the 25 years of aging. Plenty of creamy vanilla and honey to go with the malty foundation, along with coal tar, licorice root, and olive, with a hint of brine, juniper, unsweetened dark chocolate, and tobacco (cigars in a humidor?). Very nice. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)",150.0,89,53.9,
1181,Dave Broom,"Funny to think how recently Caol Ila was an Islay giant that was kept pretty much under wraps by its owner. These days it has cemented its reputation as the island’s Mr. Consistent. This version shows its character the best, a nose that mixes seashore and grass with a distinct hint of smoked bacon. The peatiness isn’t dominant, but flows throughout the palate, scenting, lifting, and subtly changing the mix. A delicious oiliness makes it a great food whisky.",50.0,89,43.0,1.0
1182,Dave Broom,"Caol Ila in unpeated guise. There’s no age statement, but what you get is a mix of the fresh and the mature: a vibrant attack with fresh Victoria plum, grapes, and a hint of oiliness. Give it time and the sensation is like afternoon tea at your auntie’s, with thickly-buttered scones dripping with honey or pineapple jam. The palate is equally sweet and gentle, and only needs a little drop of water to reveal light spice. A wee beauty.",110.0,89,59.6,1.0
1183,Dave Broom,"Aged in first-fill American oak, this shows a real brightness, crisp fruit, and some smoke—it’s not really unpeated—and wet grass, before moving into pear and tarragon. The palate is intense, with a hay note, then an almost fino sherry-like note before sashimi emerges. Reduced, there’s more of a soft flow, though there’s still a touch of green olive minerality. A steal at this price. Snap it up.",140.0,89,55.9,1.0
1184,Dave Broom,"Cragganmore is a deep malt but its richness is often obscured by its fruity sweetness. A period in port pipes allows this element to be amplified. The black currant is now fully fruited and acts as a flavor bridge while the meatiness that sits underneath and often unseen is revealed. Think cherry pipe tobacco, clove, and dark fruits. Sweet, but not too sweet, and always identifiably Cragganmore. For me, the pick of the bunch.",67.0,89,43.0,1.0
1185,Gavin Smith,"An inviting and complex nose of honey, orchard fruits, apple blossom, rosewater, and subtle cinnamon. Rich and creamy in the mouth, with initially intensely sweet fruit and spice notes, followed by ginger, toffee, and vanilla. The finish is warming, gently spicy, and medium in length. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling. (4,932 bottles)",600.0,89,55.7,

1187,Gavin Smith,"Primary maturation took place in an ex-bourbon cask, then from 2006 in a cask sourced from the vineyard of Chateau Haut Marbuzet, previously used to hold Cabernet Sauvignon. A final three years were spent in a newly-emptied bourbon barrel. Gingerbread, summer berries, and fig rolls on the nose. Fudge and vanilla. Black cherries, raisins, lots of lively spice, and a red wine ‘edge’ in the mouth. Freshly-baked ginger cake in the long, spicy finish. Cask number 10; 223 bottles.",,89,48.1,1.0
1188,Gavin Smith,"After initial maturation in American white oak, this 1991 expression was filled into a 15 year old Lepanto brandy cask from Gonzales Byass in May 2003, ultimately being re-racked into a fresh ‘distillery run’ bourbon barrel in August 2009. Caramel and white chocolate on the nose, malt, fudge, cinnamon, and nutmeg, then burnt treacle and hot brandy. Malt, sweet spice, almonds, bananas, and fudge on the palate. Spicy fruits in the lengthy Armagnac-like finish. Cask number 1; 233 bottles.",,89,57.9,1.0
1189,Gavin Smith,"Matured in European oak butts, this 1998 single malt has a nose of soft toffee, vanilla, and orchard fruits. The palate is very full and sweet, even sugary, with baked apples, peaches in cream, and cinnamon. Medium to long in the finish, with fruity oak, lingering ginger, and pepper. (5,352 bottles)",340.0,89,54.8,1.0
1190,John Hansell,"Mahogany color. Full-bodied, thick and chewy. Incredibly rich aroma and flavors of toffee, fudge, spice cake, ripe fruit, burnished leather, and oak. Nicely balanced throughout, with a long, satisfying finish.",160.0,89,46.1,1.0
1191,Gavin Smith,"The nose offers tinned peaches, fresh ginger, and a slightly herbal note. The palate is voluptuous, with vanilla, malt, vigorous spices, and white chocolate. Lingering coffee and gingery oak in the finish.",145.0,89,46.0,1.0
1192,John Hansell,"Soothing vanilla cream, with additional notes of spice cake, coconut marshmallow, tiramisu, fresh cut grass, and a hint of evergreen. A true ""comfort"" whisky. Just don’t add any water, because it will fall flat. This whisky is great just the way it is.",245.0,89,42.0,1.0
1193,Gavin Smith,"This is non-chill filtered and carries no age statement. The nose is earthy, with damp herbaceous borders, quite acrid smoke, and spicy cranberries. Fresh, juicy red berries on the palate, with background peat smoke becoming ashy, with rich red wine notes. The red wine persists in the finish, accompanied by prickly black pepper. £70; Not available in the U.S.",97.0,89,46.0,1.0
1194,John Hansell,"The oldest whisky ever bottled by Glenfarclas. Fortunately, Glenfarclas ages very nicely. This whisky proves my point. It is very complex, with notes of burnished leather, roasted nuts, fruit cake, toffee apples, sultana, damp peat, and sappy oak. A very soothing whisky, with the depth and maturity one hopes for in a whisky this old. Only 110 bottles produced and only 18 destined for the U.S.",6000.0,89,44.4,1.0
1195,Dave Broom,"Amber in color and again some fresh fruitiness, this time mixed with a little cereal. The same dry grass you get on the 1981, but here there’s a nutty, biscuity edge above that meaty solidity. The palate shows slight oiliness and roasted red pepper, that changes into blackberry as it opens. Needs roughly the same amount of water to open fully, which also brings out chamois leather and then barley sugar sweets. Clean but rich — that’s Glenfarclas. (A U.S. exclusive.)",329.0,89,56.0,1.0
1196,Dave Broom,"Although from a refill, the mahogany color suggests a short previous use. Some nose burn, with a mature edge of leather and dark chocolate. Here’s Glenfarclas in a darker guise, with raisin and a savory aspect; think roast pheasant and walnuts, lamb and mint sauce. The palate is big, thick, and sweet with lots of extract, but also Turkish delight, sultana, and prune. While sherried, it’s not in any way overcooked; the tannins are balanced, the sweetness massive. £625",1052.0,89,57.2,1.0
1197,Dave Broom,"Unusually named—it refers to the price paid for the distillery—here is Glenfarclas in slightly lighter guise than usual. Fresh and clean at the start, with hints of sweet nut and soft cooked fruits; subtly sherried elements then begin to come through. The palate is balanced, with supple tannins and a dark depth to the mid-palate. Those sweet fruits in the nose continue all the way through. Refined and rather lovely. £85",130.0,89,,1.0
1198,John Hansell,"Soothing and seamless on the nose and palate with chewy toffee, molasses, nougat, almond butter, vanilla fudge, cinnamon spice, and nutmeg, along with gentle tobacco notes emerging later on the palate. A pleasing dry finish offsets the sweeter notes. A delicious whisky from beginning to end.",120.0,89,40.0,1.0
1199,Dave Broom,"A vatting of different ages of Glenfiddich (the youngest being 14 years old) aged in American oak, then married in virgin American oak casks on which folk from the States had written their hopes and dreams…Awww! Deliciously fruity and clean, it’s all pear juice, crème brûlée, fudge, cool mint, and dessert apple. With water, there’s dusty cinnamon, kiwi, and milk chocolate. The oak acts as a smoothing base for this fruitiness. A lovely idea and a lovely whisky.",99.0,89,48.8,1.0
1200,John Hansell,"Amber gold color. Surprisingly smoky aroma balanced nicely with mature oak notes, roasted nuts, tobacco, and malty sweetness in the background. Firm body. Delicious flavors of toasted oak, roasted nuts, smoke, leather, and malt. The flavors are interwoven nicely with great balance. Satisfying finish.",110.0,89,43.0,
1201,Gavin Smith,"Distilled at Glen Garioch when peated barley was still being used, this 1991 vintage is quite reticent on the nose, considering its strength. Subtle malt and fudge notes, plus a hint of wood smoke. Fresh fruits and a sherbet ‘zing’ on the palate, with a suggestion of treacle. Developing spicy smokiness. Fruitiness is emphasized when water is added. The ‘zing’ — now ginger — lasts to the end of the medium-length finish, with advancing, discreet oak. (Only 120 bottles for the U.S.)",100.0,89,54.7,1.0
1202,John Hansell,"A lovely example of what not chill-filtering can do for a whisky. Meticulous cask selection also helps play a part here. Very straightforward on the surface (no surprises), but with vibrant, well-defined flavors and a comforting creamy texture on the palate. Bright fruit defines this whisky (lime, kiwi, ripe melon, sultana, fresh peach), accompanied by honeyed malt, heather, and a hint of spice and smoke. A fun whisky, suitable for many moods and occasions. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",100.0,89,55.0,1.0
1203,Gavin Smith,"This limited edition release of Glen Garioch is the first from the Aberdeenshire distillery to have been matured entirely in oloroso sherry casks. Just 1,000 cases of the 14 year old expression are available globally. Old leather, slightly earthy, sultanas, white pepper, and a hint of lemon pith on the nose. The palate is big and bold, with more pepper, plus cinnamon caramel, orange, and abundant sherry. Enduring spice, licorice, and slightly smoky raisins in the finish.",98.0,89,56.3,1.0
1204,Gavin Smith,"The Massandra winery, which supplies casks for Glenglassaugh’s Massandra Connection bottlings, is the oldest in Crimea, and reputedly produced Tsar Alexander III’s favorite wines. The 1973 distillation, which has been finished in sherry casks, has a nose of sultanas, cinnamon, sweet grass, and herbal notes in the background. Bung cloth, char, and finally damp undergrowth. Complex aromatic progression. Mouth-coating, with sweet, spicy tropical fruit notes and oloroso. Slowly drying, with bitter orange and mild tannins at the close. £645",1087.0,89,44.5,1.0
1205,Gavin Smith,"This 26 year old single cask Glengoyne was matured in a first-fill European oak sherry butt that yielded 339 bottles. It offers a nose of sultanas, figs, and vanilla, plus white pepper and a hint of linseed. Succulent in the mouth, the palate yields sweet sherry, honey, and contrasting lemon juice and pepper. The finish is lengthy, but dries rapidly, with lively pepper, oak tannins, and a final fatty note. £350",557.0,89,54.6,1.0
1206,Dave Broom,"If Cragganmore is sometimes overlooked, then what of this poor Lowlander whose qualities are consistently overlooked? Again, here we have a pale color suggesting use of refill casks, but whereas Cragganmore was reticent to the point of being mute, this is expressive and lively. The nose, with intense floral notes of lilac blossom, freesia, and chamomile, is a revelation. These are backed with a thick, unsalted butter note that suggests that the cask might not have been as quiet as first imagined. Give it time, and out come boiled sweets and a fresh green note, like a just-whittled stick. A hint of wheat chaff and fragrant grasses brings to mind lying in a summer meadow watching the dust motes dance in the sunshine. The mouth is sweet and lemon-accented with a pickup of a pleasant chalkiness on the nose that gives it the suggestion of a fino sherry or Vin Jaune. I like its energy, and feel that the addition of water reduces its vibrancy, so for drinking purposes I’d have a glass of ice cold water on the side. All in all impressive, with just a hint of soap on the finish taking it below the 90 mark.",189.0,89,55.1,1.0
1207,John Hansell,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Amber Aroma: Rich and rather full for Glenlivet, with nuts and fruit, drenched with layers of toffee and caramel. Palate: Rich and enveloping-almost chewy-with notes of toffee and caramel up front. Delicate fruit, nuts and spice emerge mid-palate, adding complexity, becoming dry with a long spicy finish",200.0,89,46.0,1.0
1208,John Hansell,"Very stylish. Quite refined too, with notes of vanilla, peaches and flowering currant. The whisky is very soft on the palate, delicate and almost bashful at times. Indeed, it may take a couple of dates with this whisky for it to fully to reveal itself. The whisky finishes toasty, with a pleasing cereal grain maltiness. Some whiskies are great after dinner; others make wonderful pre-dinner drams. This one is great anytime.",165.0,89,53.1,1.0
1209,John Hansell,"New packaging and new whisky too-sort of. According to Glenlivet’s whisky maker Jim Cryle, Archive is now being bottled in smaller batches, allowing them to be more selective in the casks used to improve its quality and flavor. I believe that it has worked. It tastes more refined. Along with Archive’s signature creamy toffee notes, I’m picking up beautiful floral, vanilla, and fruity notes (peaches, pineapple, coconut) on the nose and palate, with subtler nutty, anise threads throughout. An elegant expression of Glenlivet.",130.0,89,43.0,1.0
1210,John Hansell,"Lovely bouquet of dried citrus fruit, honeyed apricot and plum, complemented by exotic wood spice, malty vanilla, and a hint of mint and anise. Similar follow-through on the palate, with the sweeter notes up front, full fruit impact mid-palate, leading to a dry, peppery, exotic wood spice finish. The whisky evolves on the palate and is very impressive, with its only blemish being a bit too dry and oaky on the finish.",700.0,89,52.3,1.0
1211,John Hansell,"This whisky fits the profile of other extra-matured Glenlivet whiskies I’ve tasted. Notes of coconut and other assorted tropical fruit, old rum, caramel custard, shortbread cookies, vanilla malt, and a hint of cotton candy. This is all balanced by polished oak. A soothing, rather sweet whisky (which is quite surprising for its age).",305.0,89,44.7,1.0
1212,John Hansell,"For those of you drinking whisky long enough, it was a Glenmorangie Tain L’Hermitage 1978 Vintage that kick-started this whole exotic finish trend by Glenmorangie about 10 years ago. That one wasn’t sold here in the U.S., but this one is (although this one costs about four times as much as the original one did when it was released). Both were racked in used bourbon barrels before being finished in Hermitage red wine casks from northern Rhone. The best of these limited release Glenmorangies, like the Fino Sherry Finish expression several years ago, add complexity and intrigue without masking Glenmorangie’s lovely subtle complexity. This one does a pretty good job of it, although there’s a lot of fruit here (an obvious contribution of the wine). Complex fruit, with notes of plum, raspberry, nectarine, blueberries, and a hint of lemon. Underneath the fruit, there’s nougat, dark chocolate and cocoa. Towards the finish, the whisky becomes nicely dry with oak lingering on the palate.",200.0,89,46.0,1.0
1213,John Hansell,"When compared to the 10 year old, this one’s richer, with darker fruit and more caramelized sweet notes, paired with accentuated dried wood spice, while the 10 year old is more vibrant and floral. Like the 10 year old, there’s good balance here.",135.0,89,43.0,1.0
1214,John Hansell,"Finished (extra-matured, as they are now saying) in Sauternes casks. This expression replaces the Madeira wood finish. Beautiful sweet notes of honeycomb, sultana, apple pie, and white chocolate balanced by peach, coconut, and pineapple. Gentle background spice. The Sauternes cask adds extra weight and viscosity. The sweetness is not cloying, nor does it dominate the flavor profile. A good demonstration of the benefits of wood finishing.",75.0,89,46.0,1.0
1215,Gavin Smith,"Milsean is the latest Private Edition release from Glenmorangie. After initial bourbon barrel maturation, the whisky spent several years in heavily-toasted Portuguese red wine casks. Fresh fruits on the early nose, with ginger and a hint of musk. Coconut and icing sugar emerge. Smooth and rounded on the palate with a big fruit hit that becomes more citric in time, plus lively oak spices. Lingering in the finish, with persistent spice. Finally, plain chocolate and chili.",99.0,89,46.0,1.0
1216,Gavin Smith,"The ninth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition series was matured fully in American oak barrels that previously contained rye whiskey. A reticent early nose: melon and a hint of lemon, then warm, oily cereal notes and honey develop.

1217,John Hansell,"It's nice to see Gordon & MacPhail bottlings at strengths higher than 40%, and it makes this already hefty whisky even more so. It is fragrant (with subtle heather notes), rich and malty (and quite thick in texture), with notes of honey and vanilla. Interwoven fruit (sultana, along with subtle lemon and orange) add complexity. All this sweetness is rounded out nicely with a long, dry, oaky/spicy finish. A delicious, evolving whisky.

(The brand manager tells me that they wanted to wait until the stocks of the current 1980s vintage (a 1987) were depleted. It’s fresh, lively, and uncluttered, glowing with bright fruit (mandarin orange, nectarine), lemon meringue pie, and a creamy vanilla sweetness that coats the palate. A gently dry oak finish with subtle anise and very dark chocolate. A perky Glenrothes, and a lot of fun to drink.",120.0,89,43.0,1.0
1219,Dave Broom,"Glenrothes is always this fascinating mix of the malty and the fruity and is one of those drams which needs time in the glass to open. Given that time, you will be rewarded with date, raisin, some fudge, and some real savory depth before a sprinkling of trail mix and a sweetening into nougat and caramel, spice and chocolate. A replacement for the old Select Reserve, this is a magnificent Glenrothes and at a great price, so don’t dare moan.",55.0,89,40.0,1.0
1220,Gavin Smith,"The initial Glenrothes 1995 was released in 2011. This edition comprises first-fill American oak casks seasoned with dry oloroso sherry. Significant sherry cask influence early on the nose, with a savory note, rich fruitcake, cherries, malt, and developing vanilla custard. Supple in the mouth, with honey, berry fruits, and citrus notes. Spicier in time. The finish dries slightly, with cinnamon and a sprinkling of black pepper.",123.0,89,45.0,1.0
1221,Gavin Smith,"Cask # 328 was filled at Glenturret on December 16, 1986 by stillmen Hugh Malloy and Chic Brock. After 28 years of maturation, it has yielded 240 bottles. It is exclusively available online at thefamousgrouse.com. Boiled fruit sweets, heather, hazelnuts, old oak, and musty bung-cloths on the nose, plus slight mint. The palate is rich and fruity, with honey, rum, vanilla fudge, and ginger root. Spicy milk chocolate and coconut in the lengthy finish, with non-intrusive oak. Classic Glenturret. £200",313.0,89,46.8,1.0
1222,Gavin Smith,"A belated addition to Diageo’s Special Releases range for 2011, this offering is from the now-demolished distillery in Stonehaven, which closed in 1985. Just 1,500 bottles are available, and maturation has taken place in American oak refill casks filled in 1970. Resin, malt, nutmeg, and wood polish on the nose, with developing vanilla and brittle toffee. Full in the mouth, slightly oily, and notably fruity, with heather and cinnamon notes. Pepper and bitter orange in the long finish. £525",824.0,89,59.4,1.0
1223,John Hansell,"Bright gold color. Soft aromas and flavors of delicate honey, heather, subtle spice, tropical fruit, creamy vanilla, and malt. Nicely balanced throughout the palate and very clean-this whisky was aged in an excellent cask. There are no off flavor notes from the wood at all, nor is it too woody on the finish. Rather, it finishes soft, gentle, and clean.",165.0,89,40.3,1.0
1224,John Hansell,"Clean and fragrant on the nose, with aromas of dried heather, germinating barley, and white chocolate. Soft, sweet malt along with honeycomb, crème brulee, and a hint of fruit puree. The palate is soothingly malty, delivering what the aroma promised (first the sweet notes, then dried heather and spice), with a dry, polished oak finish. The extra aging adds depth, and the cask was obviously a good one, with no hint of being tired or old.",210.0,89,46.0,1.0
1225,John Hansell,"Yellow gold color. Fresh, floral aromas (reminiscent of a spring garden), creamy vanilla, honey, heather, subtle fruit, and a hint of toasted oak. Elegant and nicely balanced. Medium in body, but richly so. Richly flavored, too, and nicely balanced, with notes that echo the aromas. In fact, this is one of the most balanced whiskies I've had in quite a while. A hint of salt, spice, and seaweed on the finish linger on indefinitely. This whisky is a pure joy to drink and demonstrates why Highland Park is so highly regarded. The fact that it was aged in a bourbon cask allows this whisky's more subtle notes to be fully appreciated. Quite delicious!",150.0,89,,1.0
1226,Gavin Smith,"This is a recent addition to the portfolio, and has been matured in a mixture of thirteen American oak butts and hogsheads. These have given an out-turn of 893 bottles.

1227,John Hansell,"Many of the independent  H.P. bottlings are aged in bourbon casks, and, like this one, exhibit creamy vanilla, honeyed malt, and citrus. I’m also picking up some more subtle heather, brine, coconut, and nougat. This one is clean on the palate and shows nice balance, with enough dry oak on the finish to counter the whisky’s sweeter notes. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)",120.0,89,48.8,1.0
1228,Gavin Smith,"More obviously sherried on the nose than either Sigurd or Ragnvald; buttery, with figs, sultanas, vanilla, a hint of leather, and ripe oranges. Rich and silky on the complex palate; overt sherry, ginger, and lots of old leather and sweet smoke. Spice is quite muted here. The finish is lengthy, with plain chocolate, wood smoke, figs, and tingling spices. Luxurious and accomplished. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €1,000",1348.0,89,45.1,1.0
1229,Gavin Smith,"The latest addition to the Jura range has been matured in American white oak casks before spending three years in Gonzalez Byass oloroso sherry butts. The mellow nose is lightly oily, with figs, sherry, orange, and a savory note. Vanilla emerges, along with malt, and finally a hint of cinnamon and parma violets. Soft and supple on the palate, with more orange, plus cocoa, sultanas, and dates. The finish is lengthy and features dark chocolate, raisins, aniseed, and subtle spices.",560.0,89,44.0,

1232,John Hansell,"This whisky shows no signs of immaturity considering its age. Indeed, enjoying Laphroaig young and at a higher strength is the best way to appreciate the distillery’s true character. Very medicinal and “closed up” neat, but comes alive with a splash of water. Powerful notes of tar, charcoal, smoked seaweed, and licorice root, mercifully tamed by ripe barley and honeyed malt laced with vanilla. Warm, smoky, charred oak finish. (U.S. only)",85.0,89,55.9,1.0
1233,Dave Broom,"A very tarry start, like fence posts which have just been treated with creosote. Add in some smoked fish alongside dried grass, and you have all the requisite elements for a classic Laphroaig. The palate is massively smoky to start, a real peat bomb, but that eruption recedes, allowing barley and sweetness to come through. This is a serious dram which needs water to coat the tongue. Very good. £65/500 ml",108.0,89,54.8,1.0
1234,Dave Broom,"Bold, with smoked fish (Arbroath smokies), dried fruits. Has requisite density of character with classic notes of freshly-laid tarmac and medicine. A lemon edge adds some lift. The complexity continues on the tongue, which is very juicy; vanilla-accented but with plenty of seaweed-like smoke that shifts into licorice. Long, balanced, and thick in the center, with some (smoked) dried thyme on the finish. £70/500 ml",118.0,89,52.4,1.0
1235,Gavin Smith,"This veteran Ledaig release from Tobermory distillery is the oldest to date, having been made in 1972. 500 bottles are available globally. Musty old leather, malt, and plum pudding on the slightly earthy, phenolic nose. In time the leather becomes suppler, with ripe figs and, finally, soot. Voluptuous in the mouth, with sweet sherry, plain chocolate, and soft spices, plus black pepper, an emerging note of coal. The finish is very long, with citrus fruit, chili, smoke, and subtle oakiness.",5450.0,89,46.3,1.0
1236,Gavin Smith,"Some of the first peated spirit produced in the late 1990s at Tobermory Distillery has gone into this bottling, which has been finished in marsala wine casks. The nose yields earthy malt, new leather, printer’s ink, and a final fragrant note. Big, bright flavors of orchard fruits and sweet peat on the palate, plus black pepper and dessert wine. Ashy peat, burnt oak, and lingering pepperiness in the finish.",155.0,89,51.0,1.0
1237,Geoffrey Kleinman,"From a Speyside distillery whose malt is more commonly found in blends. An enticing and complex nose balances sweet honey, acidic dried orange, rich walnut, and light smoke. On the palate these elements come together well with complexity and balance. Things get spicy in the mid-palate, with black pepper, salt, ginger, and a bump in smoke. A long finish rounds everything off, showcasing smoke and orange. Lots of character and flavor for an uncommon malt. (U.S. only)",105.0,89,55.8,
1238,John Hansell,"Longmorn is now being bottled one year older. Whisky companies seem to be discontinuing odd-year whiskies. Bowmore recently extended their 17 year old to 18. Ironically, in both instances, the older whiskies serve up more sherry and fruit. Both the Longmorn 15 and Bowmore 17 were considered benchmark whiskies, so these changes weren’t without risk. Still, in both instances, the new expressions won’t disappoint. This new Longmorn shows a mouth-coating maltiness -- Longmorn’s signature characteristic. Along with this, there’s ripe barley, honeyed fruit (peach, with subtle sultana and pineapple), gently complex nuts (almonds, brazil nuts), and a hint of chocolate-covered coconut. A lush, fruity-sweet dram that lingers long on the palate. True Longmorn devotees will still want to purchase a bottle of the 15 year old while they can.",90.0,89,48.0,1.0
1239,Dave Broom,"Longmorn may be slightly better known, but it’s still pretty much a cult whisky — with a huge following in Japan, where every whisky bar seems to have multiple expressions. This bottling shows it in its lushest guise, with masses of caramelized soft fruits, banana, cream toffee, and chocolate. The palate shifts between raisin and plum. Elegant.",110.0,89,48.0,1.0
1240,Dave Broom,"Immediately identifiably Longmorn: that ridiculous, highly amenable mix of soft fruits, masses of sweet spice, candied peels, coconut, and sticky toffee pudding. In fact, it’s almost over the top in its lushness. Leans into the mouth with masses of mace, then soft fruits and marzipan develop. Unctuous, long, and ripe, the wood shows just a little, but the depth and richness holds it in check. Very good. £97",154.0,89,52.6,1.0

1242,John Hansell,"Even drier and expressing more of the complex floral and spice notes found in the 15 year old. However, by the time the whisky reaches mid-palate, the dried fruits, dried spices, and general wood notes become prominent, preventing the whisky from revealing other sides of its usually multi-faceted personality. It’s still a very fine whisky, but not as good as the 15, regardless of price.",220.0,89,43.0,1.0
1243,Dave Broom,"Initially, this is Macallan in effusive Willy Wonka mood, with lots of toffee, chocolate, greengage, and light oiliness. The aroma thickens with water, and with it a more serious mien: brogues buffed to a high sheen. The palate is equally rich and layered, with cereal, black cherry, discreet oak. A complex mix, as befits a gentleman’s dram that every gentleman should have. £95",151.0,89,56.0,1.0
1244,John Hansell,"Toffee and nougat, with a lacing of cotton candy. It then turns richly nutty-almost chewy-with notes of dried apricot, sultana, and a touch of red currant. Firm, dry, oak resin finish. A well-structured whisky, indicative of the Mortlach pedigree.",100.0,89,43.0,1.0
1245,Dave Broom,"Immediately identifiable as Mortlach, with a pleasant, feral mélange of meat mingled with milk chocolate and gorse. There is elegant sweetness here, but expressed as a mix of the bittersweet caramelized juices stuck to the bottom of a roasting pan, with honey. The palate, unsurprisingly, is big, and medium dry, but here as well there’s some sweetness in the form of black fruits. Mortlach, but in a slightly subtler guise than usual. £60",94.0,89,48.0,1.0
1246,John Hansell,"Finished in sauternes wood. I really love how the appetizing notes of Pulteney marry with the sweet notes of the sauternes wine cask. Light-medium in body, but good viscosity. Fresh brine throughout, with honey-drenched melon fruit, pineapple in syrup, citrus, and a hint of cotton candy and lightly toasted marshmallow. A delicious marriage of two high-caliber drinks categories.",100.0,89,45.0,
1247,Gavin Smith,"WK209 is named after a steam herring drifter registered in the Caithness port of Wick, where Old Pulteney is distilled.

Spicy sherry, heather, and black coffee in the luxurious finish. €50",63.0,89,46.0,1.0
1248,John Hansell,"One of the last remaining vintages from an Islay distillery which will be missed dearly. This is obviously from a sherry cask, and the peat smoke, sherry, and oak-aging is married nicely here. It a brooding Port Ellen. Notes of peat fires, fig, kippers, toffee, vanilla, and dry oak take turns entertaining the palate. Considering its age, it isn’t excessively oaked, and the Port Ellen character still shines through. If you’re going to track down a bottle of Port Ellen before they get really difficult to find, this one is worth serious consideration.",195.0,89,46.0,1.0
1249,John Hansell,"An elder Port Ellen, but still showing plenty of Port Ellen character. It’s chock full of kiln smoke, damp forest, seaweed, charcoal, brine, and tar. Additional notes of licorice root, kalamata olive, cinnamon, and black pepper, with teasing citrus emerging occasionally. Warming, tarry, dry smoke finish. An old-fashioned, pungent Islay whisky.",400.0,89,55.3,1.0
1250,Dave Broom,"This, the fifth of TWE’s ongoing Elements bottlings of Islay’s legendary closed distillery, does not disappoint. The nose is akin to salted chocolate, with a wasabi-like earthiness lurking behind. Port Ellen’s characteristic flintiness is there in the form of rock-pools and hot sand inside seashells, while the smoke hints at sphagnum moss, marsh gas, and burnt cake. The palate has touches of smoked eel and a hint of pear. As enigmatic as ever, in other words. £175 (500 ml)",279.0,89,57.9,1.0
1251,Dave Broom,"Matured in refill European oak sherry butts, this year’s Special Release has more weight than many previous expressions and a fascinating smokiness that comes across like a just-lit fire: fire lighter, burning paper, fire grate, and wood smoke. The more active oak adds walnut skin notes and rich dried fruits before the smoke returns. All very sophisticated with enough sweetness to balance. Excellent, but, ouch, that price!",3700.0,89,53.9,1.0

The palate is somewhat tart, with oranges and pepper, while the finish dries to coffee and spicy oak. A lovely example of a much-mourned malt.",261.0,89,53.8,1.0
1253,John Hansell,"A limited edition of 2000 bottles. Thick and syrupy on the palate, accentuated with vanilla and shortbread. You’ll also find pleasing peaches & cream, zingy citrus fruit, along with a hint of nuts, spice, and a pinch of salt on the palate. A nice addition to the 14 year old distillery bottling. Kudos for bottling it at cask strength.",300.0,89,54.0,1.0
1254,John Hansell,"Older Springbanks are becoming hard to find, and this one won't disappoint. It is packed with citrus notes (lemon, orange) often found in whiskies over 30 years old. Along with them you'll find subtle spice notes (especially cinnamon), red licorice, polished oak, and that signature Springbank fresh brininess, albeit a bit reserved. This Springbank is not as heavily sherried as some other older bottlings that have come and gone. If I wanted to be picky, I would like to see more of the Springbank briny zest and freshness here, but, giving its age, it is understandably reserved. This whisky's best feature is how surprisingly clean, rounded, and polished it is for 33 years old. Very nice.",485.0,89,,1.0
1255,John Hansell,"Finished in a rum cask. Gently sweet (caramel, vanilla cream, kiss of honey), with balancing fruit (lime, kiwi, green grape) and spice (white pepper, brine). Youthful (but not immature). Invigorating briny finish. I don’t know what kind of rum cask was used, but it comes across more like sugar cane juice-based rhum agricole than the molasses-based rums. Very nice! (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",105.0,89,58.0,
1256,John Hansell,"Even with a refill sherry cask, bright fruit is the main theme to this whisky: strawberry-rhubarb pie, red raspberry preserve, red currant. But there’s honeyed malt for balance, along with suggestions of

Soothing, mellowing finish of considerable depth.",200.0,89,40.0,1.0
1260,John Hansell,"More subtle and teasing. Not as much a knock-out punch on the finish like the Talisker 10 and 18, but rather more steady intense blows to the abdomen for many rounds. An aging Talisker, but still with many redeeming qualities. It is drier than its younger siblings, with less fruit and more of a stony texture, with dried spices and lingering leather notes. This whisky requires more patience and demands more concentration, but it is still rewarding to the seasoned aficionado (with some extra pocket change).",225.0,89,57.8,1.0
1261,John Hansell,"A graceful Talisker. Soft toffee and caramel with balanced, gentle fruit. Hints of boat dock wood, damp peat, and fish nets.

Well rounded, with enough depth on the palate to make up for the lack of punch in younger expressions.",350.0,89,50.7,1.0
1262,Gavin Smith,"Diageo has introduced this new no age statement variant of Talisker single malt. The name reflects the distiller’s aspiration to enhance the maritime notes in this expression. Refill and rejuvenated casks have both contributed to its maturation. The nose is youthful but rounded, with brine, burning wood embers, vanilla, and honey.

wood. As a result, you can’t help comparing it to Macallan and while there’s
none of the oily depths, there are fragrant top notes of honey and apple before
some resin and warm leather develop, but no sulfur. Some of the richness is
lost with water, so I’d leave it as is. This is a stunner for a 10 year old and
is marked accordingly. Value Pick £34",52.0,89,40.0,1.0

Subtle mint and cinnamon spice, along with soft fruit and light tobacco on the finish round out the flavor profile. A bourbon comfortably positioned between Jim Beam white and the more premium Signature Series releases.",35.0,89,47.5,2.0
1304,Lew Bryson,"Can you say “11 year old Old Grand-Dad”? There’s a snap of hot, happy rye in the nose, sweet corn and cinnamon banging along, but there’s vanilla and oaky dryness. I had a bottle of OGD Bonded handy, and it’s close. It’s like my favorite young bonded strapped in oaky spice, with a more mature, drier finish. I’m told this has even more rye in the mashbill. If you like OGD, get this and see what more age does. Price is per 375 ml.",50.0,89,45.0,
1307,John Hansell,"A limited-edition (600 bottles), cask strength version of Angel’s Envy. More alcohol and more portwood influence than that standard release. Rich and lush in texture, with a sweet personality. Notes of ripe berried fruit, maple syrup, honeyed tangerine, vanilla, and background spice. Distinctive, with a soothing, velvety finish. I’d prefer less port influence, more aligned with the standard release, but it’s still a very enjoyable bourbon. Best after dinner, with a cigar.",150.0,89,61.85,2.0
1308,John Hansell,"The third cask strength release and, like all Angel’s Envy bourbons, this one is finished in port barrels. When compared to the standard bottling, this cask strength release is packed with more of everything. It’s lush and palate-coating. Fruit forward too, with honey-coated cherries, sultana, ripe peach, pineapple in syrup, peppered with clove and vanilla, and wrapped in a silky smooth finish. This whiskey pushes the envelope of port finishing.",170.0,89,59.65,2.0
1309,Dave Broom,"Poor old Auchroisk. Not only couldn’t anyone pronounce it correctly (it’s “Oth Rusk,” in case you’re interested), but in recent years it’s seen its Singleton prefix hijacked by other larger distilleries — Glendullan, Dufftown, Glen Ord — leaving it somewhat forgotten by malt mavens. Part of the old J&B stable, it continues to make a malty/nutty spirit, a style which is also somewhat out of favor in the world of single malts. 
Maybe this bottling (in a rather spiffing retro pack) will redress the balance. The color is full gold, and though initially the nose shows the high bottling strength to the max, beneath the prickly heat is eucalyptus oil alongside those signature nutty/cereal notes. But here’s the difference; there’s sweetness, too: toffee and thick clover honey, even a touch of sawdust and pencil shavings before a drop of water brings out malted milk and powdered hazelnut. In other words, there’s plenty of distillery character, but good cask development. 
In the mouth, when neat, the needling alcohol slightly numbs the tongue and the effect from start to finish is a bit fragmented. Add water, however (not too much), and there’s a soft, creamy effect across the tongue with praline, almond, and a dark chocolate note as well. Be careful with the water though, as you need to retain the zesty acidity on the finish.",175.0,89,58.1,1.0
1311,Fred Minnick,"High rye is evident, with rounded baking spices up front, leather, muted caramel, vanilla, and a hint of tobacco. This ABV beast coasts with the warmth and richness of crème brûlée, toffee, cinnamon rock candy, fruit, and nutmeg. Oh wait, there’s more. Smoke kicks in toward the end with marshmallow undertones and more cinnamon, finishing strong with lasting spice. This is a cask strength sipper or a lovely bourbon on the rocks.",50.0,89,59.7,2.0
1312,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"This high-end whiskey exhibits restrained oak, elegance, and delicateness, with wonderful poached pear, cereal, crème caramel, floral, and lemon chiffon cake aromas that yield to a bright beam of tart, mouthwatering citrus—clementine, lemon, and yuzu—tingling with allspice. Bright, light, and lively, but not lacking in complexity, finishing with marshmallow, toasted almond, and marzipan. Very pretty! American single grain whiskey aged in Japanese Mizunara oak casks.",495.0,89,45.0,3.0
1313,Gavin Smith,"The oldest expression available from Speyburn, this has been aged in a mix of American oak fino sherry and bourbon casks, and is non-chill filtered. Vanilla, honey, lemon, and spice on the fragrant nose. Quite full-bodied and creamy on the palate; nutty, with malt, honey, and citrus fruit. The citrus fruit becomes spicier in the medium-length, oaky finish.",300.0,89,46.0,1.0
1314,Gavin Smith,"Of the three Singleton bottlings, Dufftown is aimed at European markets, Glen Ord at Asia, and Glendullan at the U.S. The oldest expression in the Singleton of Glendullan stable, this boasts a nose of brittle toffee, dried fruits, and new leather. Nutty toffee, drinking chocolate, banana split, and coconut on the smooth, soft palate. Peppery almonds in the slowly drying finish. Good value for the money!",70.0,89,40.0,1.0
1316,John Hansell,"Quite dark in color, turning cloudy with water. Don’t let that deter you. A thick, chewy bourbon, with layers of nutty toffee,
nougat, cocoa, and toasted marshmallow, peppered with cinnamon and vanilla. Oak and leather on the finish dry out the whiskey nicely. Not the most refined bourbon, but the flavors it delivers make up for it.",40.0,89,67.1,2.0
1317,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"A lovely balance of oak, clove, and sweetness come together on the nose, while the flavor shows both big impact and refinement. Oak-driven in style, with plenty of tannins and tobacco leaf, but the sweetness and structure stand up, pouring flavors of pecan, caramelized nuts, and toasted spices, with hints of pine before the persistent finish. A very solid and nicely polished bourbon.",50.0,89,46.0,3.0
1321,John Hansell,"Quite lush—the port influence is clearly obvious and adds a degree of opulence to this bourbon. Notes of ripe cherry dipped in caramel, then light molasses, blend in with more traditional bourbon notes of vanilla and spice. A pleasant diversion from the bourbon norm, and ideal for postprandial consumption. (It begs for a fine cigar, for those inclined.)",70.0,89,50.0,
1322,Lew Bryson,"One of the debut whiskeys at WhiskyFest New York 2012, this was finished in a barrel that held Virginia-made port…after it was used to age Bowman whiskey, a boomerang finish. The nose gives baking chocolate, tropical flowers, and yes, some of that port. Peppery and port-edged on the tongue, solid fire from the 100 proof, fat corn and fruit in the middle of the palate. Busy, but purposeful. There’s a lot here and it’s all working together.",70.0,89,50.0,3.0
1326,Lew Bryson,"Made from roasted Hopi blue corn. The nose says bourbon—sweet, corn, faint maple—but with big notes of stone fruits. It's lush. Mouth veers off in another direction with floury corn, oaked complexity, an herbal component, like crushed stems of wildflowers, and cinnamon/allspice notes. The finish is suddenly mellow, with a seductive creaminess high in the back palate. Even at a young 50%, never really fiery. Wonderfully complex, and not over-oaked; beautiful stuff.",58.0,89,50.0,3.0
1329,Lew Bryson,"Triple-distilled bourbon from Virginia. Actively aromatic, blowing right out of the glass: tart berries, hot corn, oak, and stick cinnamon. Hot, but surprisingly soft and light for 50% (triple distillation?), with sweet corn and more of the berries, wrapped in oak and a touch of char. Everything persists to the finish, including the heat, leading to a twist of oak at the end. Manages to be big but light at the same time.",50.0,89,50.0,2.0
1330,John Hansell,"The fourth in a series of limited-edition Taylor bottlings, and the first barrel-proof release. Layered sweet notes of caramel and nougat, with bright orchard fruit (especially nectarine), dried spice (vanilla, mint), and pencil shavings. The dried spice notes linger on the finish, along with tobacco. Bourbon with attitude.",70.0,89,67.25,2.0
1331,Lew Bryson,"Triple-distilled whiskey from Samuel Adams Cinder Bock beer, aged 3.5 years in Samuel Adams Utopias casks. Definite character of strong beer to the nose, very light smoke, some mixed fruit notes. Mellow smoke on the tongue, broad malt and fruit (prune plum, dried cherry, baked apple), a luxurious feel. Finish is slow and even. Flavorful, but not heavy or shouting. The casks have had a great effect here, but the distilling is skillfully done.",120.0,89,43.0,3.0
1336,John Hansell,"Clean on the palate, with honey-kissed citrus, summer fruits, crisp mint, and cinnamon, balanced by creamy vanilla and soft toffee. A solid bourbon that’s nicely rounded and vibrant. It’s very much with the current trend of American whiskeys toward no age statement; youthful and playful in nature, and versatile.",50.0,89,55.0,
1337,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Sweet citrus fruits, floral overtones, and assertive peppery spices interlace a generous framework of silky oak tannins. Charred oak and pencil shavings hint at new oak, while the frosty crispness of dry autumn leaves confirms that at least some of this whisky has spent decades in reused barrels. Touches of almond skins and peach pits cleanse the late palate. Otherwise regal and elegant, this whisky is just a touch woody.  C$30",30.0,89,40.0,4.0
1343,Jonny McCormick,"Thanks to the Gulf Stream, palm trees grow on Arran’s west coast. That prevailing sunny climate appears to have influenced this mature example from Lochranza: ripe, yellow summer fruits, lime zest, strong mixed spices, and notes of the sea, like sand brushed from seashells. Very approachable; this just oozes sunshine, bringing us the joys of sweet citrus, spices, marzipan, mango, and papaya. The finish is like slurping melted ice cream.",69.0,89,49.7,1.0
1351,John Hansell,"Aged 7 years, 1 month, and 7 days. Big and chewy, with nutty toffee, molasses, nougat, tobacco, pencil shavings, subtle
fruit, and dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla). Leather, barrel char, and a hint of licorice root on the finish. Big, bold, and very enjoyable.",50.0,89,64.45,2.0
1352,Lew Bryson,"Solid, chunky bottle with idiosyncratic whiskey inside. Straightforward rye crisps out of the glass in no-nonsense style; dry grain, sweet grass, and light but insistent anise almost wholly drown out the
barrel character. The mouth is as dry and spicy-medicinal as the nose hints at, laying down character like a winning hand: rye SNAP! heat SNAP! light tarragon SNAP! oak SNAP! and a warm wrap-up finish SNAP! Full house, flavors over sensations. Clean and interesting. Nicely played.",60.0,89,46.5,3.0
1353,Davin de Kergommeaux,"As time goes by, Still Waters is developing a recognizable house style. Acetone, fruit esters, and floral notes on the nose, with lemon biscuits and a hint of graham crackers. Hot, sweet, and lively on the palate, with blistering spices soon cooled to sweet dark licorice. Hints of Cheerios and roasted grain are Still Waters’ signatures, as this all-rye whisky shows. Clean dry grass, pears, and sweet barley sugar on a medium finish.",100.0,89,61.4,4.0
1355,Gavin Smith,"The first expression in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular Consortium of Cards Single Cask Scotch Whisky Collection was sourced from a single refill butt. The nose offers sweet peat, toffee bonbons, brine, beach tide lines, and antiseptic. Finally, a sooty chimney. The palate is zesty, with ashy peat, asphalt, chili, and citrus fruit. Dark chocolate, more soot, and extra chili in the very long finish. Quintessential Laphroaig! (665 bottles) £140",181.0,89,50.0,
1357,Geoffrey Kleinman,"If you needed proof that Scotch whiskies don’t fit neatly into established categories, look no further than this marine style, peated Highland malt. Sea salt, oyster shells, and light smoke lead the nose, with hay and apricot underneath. In the entry, the flavors burst on the palate with sea salt, honey, malt, oak, and smoke. Peat smoke really builds in the mid-palate but manages not to lose the supporting flavors, although it becomes the real star of a long finish. (U.S. only)",130.0,89,54.3,1.0
1358,Jonny McCormick,"Lush caramel, red apples, sanded oak, and olive oil first pressings with herbal overtones, this ancient grain has managed to retain its distinctive character. The palate is initially mouth-drawing with an oily structure, the flavors are a pleasing tangle of caramelized apple, toffee, and sultana, with a noticeably long finish. Banish any notion you might have of adding water right now. It’s welcoming to have a great aged grain unafraid to show its true colors. (248 bottles)",255.0,89,51.1,1.0
1359,Gavin Smith,"The initial nose is herbaceous, with green apples, then brittle toffee. Developing Juicy Fruit gum flavors. The palate is straightforward, but full and pleasing, featuring pineapple, fudge, vanilla, and almonds. The finish is medium in length, nutty, with a hint of black pepper.

1360,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 2006 and aged for 11 years in a PX sherry hogshead (#310110). Peach blossom, vanilla, and icing sugar on the nose, which becomes more floral in time. Smooth and very sweet on the substantial palate: canned pineapple in syrup, malt, and a sprinkling of cinnamon. Vibrant pineapple and sweet oak notes last to the very end of the lengthy finish. (234 bottles)",100.0,89,49.1,1.0
1361,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 2006, this was filled into a virgin French oak cask (#310865) and bottled at cask strength after 11 years. Peaches and apricots on the early nose, with a hint of cloves. Ultimately very floral, with vanilla fudge. The palate yields zesty orchard fruits, malt, and ginger. Remaining fruity in the long finish, with black pepper and juicy oak. (286 bottles)",100.0,89,58.2,1.0
1363,Dave Broom,"Smoky! Can you get dessert seaweed? Because that’s what this smells of. Candied ginger notes alongside a distinct salinity—think winkles—and in time a hint of verjus, even lanolin with water. The palate shows balanced smoke, paprika, then white pepper. The best smoky Bunna’ I’ve come across, showing maturity, balance, and no rubberiness. In time, there’s notes of old (refill) sherry cask. Released for the 2014 London Whisky Show but still commercially available. £75",114.0,89,55.6,1.0
1365,Dave Broom,"Here, Craigellachie is slimmed down and appears in slightly leaner guise, with an aromatic spritz of vetiver-heavy male cologne coming across first before fresh fruits follow on. More crisp and with slightly more obvious toasted structure. The pineapple distillery character is now dried, before the palate shows sweet chocolate pudding, char, honeysuckle, herbs, and white fruits. A classy (and large) package. (Travel Retail only) €135/liter",168.0,89,46.0,1.0
1366,Dave Broom,"The Craigellachies just keep on coming. This, the oldest of the new Original Bottling range, is the most fiercely priced. It shows balanced and slightly restrained mature notes—think of candle wax and waxed leather. Some fruit syrups, clementine, and honey then follow. The palate is thick—the distillery’s worm tubs having an effect—giving floral accents and a hint of barbecued pineapple. Not the heaviest of the range, but delicious. (Travel Retail exclusive) £500",718.0,89,52.2,1.0
1367,Gavin Smith,"This 17 year old independent bottling of Ben Nevis has somewhat unusually been matured in a fino sherry cask, rather than the more common oloroso or PX.   The nose offers initial milk chocolate notes, then a whiff of cold roast pork and oak. In time, strawberry and mango aromas appear. The mouthfeel is pleasingly full, decidedly gingery, with caramel and dry sherry. Spicy, mild sherry and raisins in a long, lively finish.",130.0,89,49.3,1.0
1368,Gavin Smith,"Aged in first-fill sherry butts, this cask strength vintage from Gordon & MacPhail features a nose which opens with savory ginger, becoming more fragrant, plus vanilla, fudge, and warm leather.

1375,Gavin Smith,"Rich on the nose, with stewed fruit, butterscotch, and soft spices. Very smooth palate delivery, with luscious fruit flavors: baked apples and peaches in syrup, then cinnamon and ginger. The medium-length finish features ebbing spice and developing milk chocolate. Likely sourced from Tullibardine Distillery.",57.0,89,46.0,1.0
1376,Lew Bryson,"Rye spice is the first thing on the nose: cinnamon-spiked hard candy, hot and juicy. Beautifully oily and bitter rye character slides across the tongue on a wave of sweet caramel and vanilla. Young, but in the eager intensity of rye, not the clumsy heat of bourbon. Rye shines here, from the first whiff to the last bitter curl on the tongue, and the wood deftly sweetens and soothes. Nicely done.",90.0,89,45.0,3.0
1381,Fred Minnick,"Caramel and earth on the nose, with freshly tilled soil, flowers, and oak just before an explosion of caramel, vanilla, allspice, and fruit. It really grows on you, with a buttery mouthfeel that presents cinnamon, honey, cornbread, marzipan, pecan pie, granola, nutmeg-dusted pumpkin pie, and a slight hint of candied ginger. Finishes long, with rich caramel. Quite tasty.",50.0,89,50.0,2.0
1382,Geoffrey Kleinman,"It’s hard to stand out in a sea of fairly bland moonshine, but Manhattan Moonshine manages to by moving beyond corn in their mashbill, with oat, rye, spelt, and malt. The result is an unaged whiskey that’s light, slightly sweet, and a symphony of cereal grains. The addition of the honey note from the oats is spot on and helps unite the grain flavors. A dash of spice creates balance and drives a dry finish. This is a wonderfully crafted and unique whiskey.",45.0,89,47.5,3.0
1383,Fred Minnick,"Quince, coconut, raspberry, and chocolate walk into an array of breads—sourdough, cornbread, Lebanese pita, and pumpernickel rye. Soon a sweetness develops over earthiness. Think hazelnut latte paired with rich lentil soup, followed by jalapeño cornbread and honey. Its strength never shows, but that promise in the taste is not followed in the finish, which is shorter than expected. If the finish held up, it would be a much stronger whiskey.",90.0,89,55.6,2.0
1385,Fred Minnick,"It starts out with several forms of wood—split, toasted, charred, and smoldering—and develops baking spices, baked apple, caramel, popcorn, and earth. A tingle hits throughout the palate, as rounded notes of chocolate, cabernet, roasted marshmallow, and white pepper develop over lingering vanilla. Candied corn and cinnamon butter develop into a medium to long finish. (36,000 bottles)",100.0,89,49.3,2.0
1387,Gavin Smith,"This is the first single malt to be released by the Last Drop Distillers, and the Aberdeen-shire veteran is old-style, well-peated Glen Garioch. Unusually, it was matured in what the bottlers describe as “a bourbon-style remade hogshead cask.” Just 118 bottles are available globally. Fruity and herbal on the nose, with apples, marzipan, ginger, linseed, and a hint of camphor. Complex and distinctive. Surprisingly vibrant fruit notes fill the perfumed palate, with allspice, before it starts to become tannic. Ultimately very mouth-drying, with subtle smoke, and a fatty spice note at the very end.",7000.0,89,45.4,
1390,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The nose is focused on cereal, hints of fresh ripe cherries, cooked fruit salad, herbs, and overt, bourbon-like charcoal. Take a sip though, and big, beautiful tones of real peat reek rush to the fore on the palate. These are sustained by sweet barley sugar, candied fruit, dry cereal, and a lush mouthfeel. The smoke, incidentally, comes from a few drops of real scotch added at blending. Very moreish. (British Columbia exclusive) $65 CAD",48.0,89,45.0,
1391,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This reformulated blend pushes classic Canadian whisky toward bigger, rye-forward flavors. Slowly, honey donuts and ripe fruit add breadth to a robust, almost oily nose. The caramel-sweet and slightly slippery palate seethes with peppery rye spices. Rugged yet balanced, with subtle complexities, the whisky develops an earthiness and almost grassy cereal notes. Gently warm going down, with cleansing bitter citrus pith on a sweet, longish finish. (Canada only) $30 CAD",23.0,89,43.4,4.0
1393,John Hansell,"Aged in a combination of sherry and bourbon oak. Bold and fresh, bursting with testosterone. Notes of damp kiln smoke, tar, wet sheep, roasted chestnuts, and pine forest bedding, along with more subtle pear, espresso, anise, and brine. Sweet notes of vanilla, fig cake, and maple syrup serve up balance and complexity. Appetizing brine and tar finish. It’s more mature than last year’s PC6. Earthier and less fruity, too! Plus, I feel that the sherry notes in PC7 integrate better than the Madeira notes from PC6. But my favorite is still the original PC5 for its purity, balance, maturity (for its age), and pristine character. (I lined up all three yesterday and tasted them side-by-side.)",150.0,89,61.0,1.0
1394,Dave Broom,"Distilled in 2002, here’s Port Charlotte with an assured maturity. Amber in color, with some smoke and a pleasing whiff of cowshed (sweet hay and cow’s breath), before rosehip syrup and ozonic freshness. Water brings out incense, cream, even a little nuttiness. The palate is gently complex; a drop of water is needed to calm the heat and reveal the smoke that interweaves between the layers. It retains its fresh acidic finish, with nutmeg, soft lemon, and pear. Excellent. £110",168.0,89,58.7,1.0
1397,Fred Minnick,"One of the first non-Kentucky bonded bourbons since the 1950s. There’s trepidation in this glass. Floral, pear, peach, and chocolate tickle the nose, leading to relief that its aroma isn’t over-oaked like some smaller distillers’ bourbons. Apricot meets dark chocolate, mint, and smoked corn, with hints of caramel, walnut shell, and a long, chicory-coffee finish. The taste is definitely not Kentucky but is convincingly delicious, especially the bitter notes toward the end. Taste this lineage; something special is starting.",50.0,89,50.0,3.0
1398,Gavin Smith,"The 2016 Fèis Ìle limited edition of Jura was triple finished in sherry casks, namely palomino fino, amoroso oloroso, and apostoles oloroso, and is non-chill filtered. The nose is soft and warming, with notes of candy, vanilla, and almonds against a sweet sherry background. The palate is rich and rounded with a significant sherry influence—dried fruits, notably raisins and prunes, new leather, and aniseed.

1399,Fred Minnick,"Aged in new American oak barrels for 1 year and then port barrels for anywhere between 3 to 6 months. Roasted corn, pine nuts, vanilla, cinnamon, and sweet oats. Oak surfaces for a second, then is quickly replaced by lovely brown sugar followed by taffy and bread pudding.

Straightforward, pleasing finish. (252 bottles)  £250",406.0,88,57.3,1.0
1446,John Hansell,"The fourth in the series of limited-edition bottlings, and one of the better ones. The impact on the whiskey of finishing in barrels made with staves that have been seasoned three to five years really is evident here. There’s plenty of wood spice, and I think it goes well with the sweet pot still characteristics. On the nose, the flavors are nicely intertwined. But on the palate, the sweeter notes (caramel, nutty toffee, fig, ripe berries, black cherry) appear first, with the dry, spicy notes (cinnamon, clove, cocoa powder, vanilla, polished leather, maduro tobacco) building to a firmly dry finish. Perhaps the dryness on the finish overstays its welcome more than I would like. But still, this is a solid effort -- and quite distinctive!",90.0,88,50.2,2.0
1447,John Hansell,"A set of two 100% rye whiskeys, triple distilled in copper pot stills, with the difference between them being the type of barrels in which they were aged. One was matured in a new charred cask, while the other one was aged in a used cask. They are packaged in half-bottle sizes (375 ml) and sold as a set for $100.
Dark in color and deep on the palate. Plenty of weight, too. A base of caramel, with warming cinnamon, persistent mint, brandy-soaked apple, tobacco, polished leather, and oak grip on the finish.",100.0,88,46.2,2.0
1448,John Hansell,"Woodford’s first permanent line extension. Aged in two barrels with different toast and char amounts.  More visceral than the standard Woodford Reserve, with a darker personality, extra wood spice, and a nice sweet foundation. Notes of cinnamon stick, dark berried fruit, roasted nuts, caramel, creamy vanilla, and polished leather.",50.0,88,45.2,
1449,John Hansell,"Nice effort overall. My gut feeling is that this whiskey might have been better a couple years ago, but I wouldn’t call the second barrel impact excessive. It’s rich and smooth, with sweeter notes of caramel, rich vanilla, and subtle candied fruit, underpinned by firm spice (especially cinnamon) which kicks in on the finish. It comes across as very traditional bourbon, with perhaps a little extra oak impact on the back end. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,88,45.0,2.0
1450,John Hansell,"Dark, big, and brooding. A mouthful of oak spice, resin, and leather. Surprisingly (and happily) the oak is never excessive — even on the finish. A mélange of toffee, maple syrup, and candy corn props it all up. The flavors aren’t as well defined as its sibling release (reviewed above), and there’s a peculiar hint of “dunnage warehouse” (think damp earth) to it that adds intrigue. A very characterful whiskey worthy of debate. Price is per 375ml.",47.0,88,45.0,2.0
1451,John Hansell,"Quite bold and crisply spicy. The most palate-piercing of the three. Well defined flavors of cool mint, warming cinnamon, honey-kissed fruit, and caramel. Briskly spicy finish. When I nose this whiskey, it feels like it’s brandishing a sword at me and shouting “en garde!”",47.0,88,45.0,2.0
1452,John Hansell,"My favorite of the two [Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel]. Surprisingly sweet, with layers of caramel, butterscotch, nougat, and subtle creamy vanilla.  This whiskey defies its age. A blend of dried spice on the nose and the finish of the palate balances the sweetness. A very enjoyable (and drinkable) whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,88,45.0,2.0
1453,John Hansell,"These releases are all the same age, but this one tastes the oldest, and in a higher weight class. Deep and dark in personality. Chewy, with some tobacco and roasted nuts thrown in the mix, along with the toffee, dark pit fruit, oak spice, and leather on the finish. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,88,45.0,
1454,John Hansell,"Well-defined flavors and clean on the palate. Wood is the driving influence here, showing plenty of dried spice throughout with a dry, resinous finish. The spice notes are accompanied by a layer of caramel, dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg), and subtle orchard fruits. The dry oak notes overstay their welcome for balance. Otherwise, it’s a very pleasant whiskey. Price per 375 ml.",47.0,88,45.0,2.0
1455,John Hansell,"Each of these three bourbons was distilled and bottled at the same time, and aged in the same warehouse for 12 years and 3 months. The main variable was the floor they were aged on. In theory, the higher up in the warehouse, the greater the temperature variation, and the more wood influence. Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

Soft and sweet, oozing caramel, honeyed vanilla, and gentle, ripe orchard fruit. Soft, gently sweet finish. Not the most complex of the three in this experiment, but it’s very easy-going and soothing on the palate. A nice pairing for a cigar, where the sweet notes will marry nicely with the cigar’s dried spice. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,88,45.0,2.0
1456,John Hansell,"Deeper, darker, more intense than the Barrel Head Aged expression. Toffee, pit fruit, Earl Grey tea, cinnamon, pencil shavings, and tobacco lead to a tannic, gripping finish. The French oak influence is tangible. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,88,45.0,2.0
1457,Fred Minnick,"Effervescent, tingly mouthfeel, but the flavor begins after the initial warmth, with hints of caramel apple, pumpkin pie, apricot, and a slight hint of caramel popcorn. Then it’s pumice, apricot, and marmalade, followed by salt water taffy, cinnamon, and a big burst of nutmeg. A long finish offers a hint of peach pie.",25.0,88,45.0,2.0
1459,John Hansell,"Sweeter notes of pecan pie, dates, sweet corn, candied fruit, and English toffee combine with dried spices -- cinnamon heat, vanilla, and mint -- which crescendoes on its long, dry finish. A nicely matured bourbon with decent weight to it. Some of the expressions in the earlier part of the decade were a little heavy on the oak, but the last couple of years have shown greater balance.",55.0,88,45.0,2.0
1460,John Hansell,"Bolder, with more spice than other Elmer T. Lee single barrel offerings I’ve tried over the years. A bit more vibrant too. Fresh notes of cinnamon, vanilla, wood shavings, ground black pepper, clove, subtle tobacco, and a hint of nutmeg on a bed of caramel and honeyed orchard fruit. Firm, warming, spicy finish. Most releases I’ve had were mellower and smoother (the 90th Birthday release comes to mind), but this is very dynamic and vibrant.",35.0,88,46.5,2.0
1461,John Hansell,"After a false start several years back, it’s a pleasure to finally see Four Roses Single Barrel available here in the U.S. This whiskey is nicely balanced, with a teasing subtleness to it. I particularly enjoy its delicately honeyed, floral, crisply spicy aroma, with underlying notes of vanilla cream and candied fruit. These flavors follow through on the palate, initially with honey-laced fruit, caramel, and soft vanilla notes, leading to a dry spiciness (mint, cinnamon) and refined oak. It finishes crisp and pleasingly dry. None of the flavors are dominant, and bottling it at 50% is a bonus.",32.0,88,50.0,2.0
1462,John Hansell,"A marriage of four different bourbon recipes aged between 11 and 13 years. Very elegant and stylish, as with many of the Four Roses offerings. Its age also shows, with a firm measure of wood spice and grip on the nose and the latter half of the palate. Soft honey, bright fruit (sultana, ripe peach, tangerine), and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, crisp rye), evolving into darker fruit and more caramelized sugars on the palate, along with leather notes on the finish.",90.0,88,55.05,2.0
1463,Fred Minnick,"Initially there’s a lot going on. Bakery confectionary meets spice rack, followed by dried oak, toasted oak, covered baked apples, canned peaches, and dried apricot. Then tobacco and leather strike before mouth-coating butterscotch and vanilla icing. Once these notes dissipate, lighter baked fruits and jams walk this into a medium finish. While good, this whiskey could have been great if it maintained its initial complexity.",120.0,88,47.2,2.0
1464,John Hansell,"The same vintage as last year’s Birthday Bourbon but aged one year longer. Last year’s version was quite intense with a lot of wood influence. What does one more year in wood do to the whisky? Surprisingly, the oak spice seems less dominant, and the flavors are more balanced. Still, this is still a serious bourbon drinker’s bourbon. Piquant, dried spice notes of vanilla, cocoa, mint, and cinnamon are tamed by layers of maple syrup, caramel, and toffee. Every once in a while some fruits try to get recognized. A powerful, after dinner bourbon.",35.0,88,48.0,2.0
1465,John Hansell,"Rather bold (especially with the spice notes), with dark fruit (black raspberry jam, plum), citrus glaze, vibrant spice (vanilla, cinnamon, clove), a dusting of cocoa powder, polished leather, and pencil shavings, all on a bed of caramel. Long, spicy finish.  A nice way to finish a rich, hearty meal, perhaps?",50.0,88,49.0,2.0
1466,John Hansell,"Many of the Birthday Bourbon releases are wood driven, and this one is particularly so. Very spicy, with warming cinnamon and cool mint. Roasted nuts, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), tangerine, and apricot emerge occasionally, along with a foundation of vanilla and caramel. Firm, resinous grip on the finish.",75.0,88,50.0,2.0
1467,John Hansell,"The last time I reviewed this whiskey was back in 2004, and this new bottling is an improvement. It’s beefier, thicker, and richer, with a good dose of rye spice. Very nice! Good balance of flavors on the nose and palate, with caramel custard, bright fruit (clementine, golden raisin, orange marmalade), a peppering of spice (fresh mint, warming cinnamon, dried vanilla), green tea, a hint of toasted marshmallow, and a pleasing dried oak, tobacco-tinged finish. Lots of character!",30.0,88,46.85,2.0
1468,John Hansell,"Barton 1792 distillery’s first-ever wheated bourbon, where the wheat replaces rye as the ‘spice’ ingredient (similar to Weller and Maker’s Mark). A sweet and fruity whiskey, with vanilla wafer, cotton candy, caramel custard, blackberry, and ripe peach. Soft oak spice and polished leather on the finish keep the sweetness in check. Very gentle in personality; a great starter bourbon.",33.0,88,45.6,2.0
1469,Gavin Smith,"Both bourbon and sherry casks were used for aging. Stewed fruits, butterscotch, and soft spices on the nose. Silky palate delivery, with honey, dark chocolate, light sherry, and cloves. Lingering finish, with citrus and allspice.",80.0,88,40.0,1.0
1470,John Hansell,"Similar in flavor to the Aberfeldy 12 reviewed below, but with more depth. There’s more orange rind in the marmalade notes, along with Clementine and coconut. The whisky finishes drier too, with a spicy flair. Still quite clean and nicely balanced throughout. A whisky for those of you who want a fun whisky that’s not heavy on the palate.",170.0,88,40.0,1.0
1471,John Hansell,"(Reviewers note: this is an exclusive bottling to Park Avenue Liquors, New York, NY.) This is signature Ardbeg: young (but not too young), bold, and with an attitude too! Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown on a campfire, with notes of damp earth, pepper, and seaweed. Still, there’s a soft underbelly of vanilla sweetness that helps to tame this beast and provide balance. A peppery, kippered, smoky finish entertains long after the whisky disappears. Make this your last whisky of the evening.",125.0,88,50.0,1.0
1472,Gavin Smith,"A proportion of the component whiskies has been matured in virgin Black Sea oak casks, while the rest has been aged in bourbon barrels. The nose is sweet, with warm cloves and soft peat; a hint of brine. When it comes to the palate—curious! Menthol and herbal notes, toasted oak, plain chocolate, sweet antiseptic. Mildly tannic in the finish, with subtle peaty spiciness. An herbal peat note lingers long.",119.0,88,46.0,
1473,Gavin Smith,"6,660 bottles of The Devil’s Punch Bowl have been released, and the component whiskies come from 24 casks filled between 1996 and 2006. They include a number of sherry butts, and some peated spirit is included in the mix. The nose offers soft, mellow malt, dried fruits, and milk chocolate. Silky smooth and deceptively drinkable at full strength, the palate is nutty and notably fruity, with ginger and brittle toffee. A hint of barbecue sauce in the sweet finish.",130.0,88,52.3,1.0
1474,Gavin Smith,"Isle of Arran distillers is now offering exclusive bottlings in the U.S. along the same lines as those already available in the UK, starting with 16 year old single cask, cask strength variants. Arran Premium Sherry Single Cask #1979 displays milk chocolate, vanilla, new leather, wood polish, and butterscotch on the nose. More vanilla in time. The palate is richly sherried, with espresso, fruit loaf, nutmeg, and old wood. Lively spices persist in the lingering, leathery finish.",130.0,88,51.1,1.0
1475,Gavin Smith,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish.",110.0,88,46.0,1.0
1476,Gavin Smith,"This 38 year old Travel Retail-exclusive expression has been aged in bourbon casks, and not chill filtered. It follows an initial batch of the same vintage, released in 2011. The nose is perfumed, with a resin note and developing vanilla and caramel popcorn. Demerara sugar and oak. Very fruity on the palate, with oranges and lemons, emerging spices, and benign oak. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. The additional maturation has given the fruity elements a greater profundity. (500 bottles)",820.0,88,45.6,1.0
1477,John Hansell,"Very fruity (peaches in syrup, pineapple, golden apple, sultana) and satisfyingly rich in texture, with coating vanilla, marzipan, and a potpourri of dried spice (especially on the nose and finish of the palate). Great balance too. Nicely done!",65.0,88,43.0,
1478,Gavin Smith,"Matured in second-fill bourbon casks, this expression of Balblair offers a distinctive aroma of bananas, along with cooking apples, sultanas, nuts, and spices. It is full-bodied and exhibits a palate of toffee and spicy fruits, and becomes increasingly chocolate-y, with distinct cocoa notes, when given time to breathe. Raisin notes also develop. The finish is lengthy and smooth, with lasting lively spice and vanilla.",130.0,88,43.0,1.0
1479,Gavin Smith,"Balblair 2001 Vintage is the first distillery bottling to be non-chill filtered, noncolored, and offered at 46%. It is 10 years old and has been matured in ex-bourbon barrels. The nose offers lemonade, vanilla, allspice, and developing milk chocolate and caramel notes. Clean and straightforward on the palate; sweet and spicy, with tangerines, eating apples, toffee, and more milk chocolate. Cocoa powder in the spicy, relatively lengthy finish. £33",53.0,88,46.0,1.0
1480,Gavin Smith,"Following the initial release of a 1997 vintage Balblair in 2007, a second edition has now been launched, with the spirit in question having benefited from an additional five years’ maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Fresh, light, and fruity on the nose: tinned peaches, pear drops, sweet apples, plus vanilla and wood putty. The palate features lots of succulent soft fruits, milk chocolate, honey, and spice. The finish is medium in length, and spicy chocolate notes persist. £55",85.0,88,46.0,1.0
1481,John Hansell,"The Balvenie continues its limited edition releases of 17 year old whiskies. Previous editions included an Islay Cask finish and a New Oak finish. This is the newest one, aged in sherry oak casks. It’s a delicious whisky, with clean, ripe, sherried fruit marrying nicely with the dry oak spices. Notes of apple pie, honeyed summer fruit, caramel toasted almonds, and toffee, with dry resinous oak on the finish to round out the sweetness. A big, full-bodied Balvenie that satisfies.",90.0,88,43.0,1.0
1482,Dave Broom,"The darkness of the hue of this, the second official release of a 40 year old from Balvenie, gives an indication of how intense the relationship between cask and spirit has been over its long sequestration. It emerges brimming with dense aromas such as tamarind paste, treacle, and Black Forest gateau. Amazingly, on the palate there’s a lift of vanilla-like sweetness before the heavier and drier elements close down on the finish. Incredibly limited; only 150 bottles produced. £2,500",,88,48.5,1.0
1483,Dave Broom,"Light gold, with good intensity and a more noticeable malty note than is common with this distillery, as well as touches of daffodil and dried honeycomb. The wood influence appears minimal to start with, but more vanilla creeps through in time; water brings out almond milk. Opens into clementine peel, pomelo, then cooked dessert apple. The palate is clean and forward; even slightly hot when neat. Remarkably assertive for a 25 year old.",599.0,88,47.8,1.0
1484,Gavin Smith,"This expression dates from 2002, when Balvenie first produced a batch of heavily peated malt. Matured in American oak casks, the nose exhibits subtle peat balanced by honey, vanilla, and ripe red apples. On the palate, the soft smoke is well integrated with vanilla, more honey, ginger, and overripe pears. Ashy peat, citrus fruits, cinnamon, and tangy oak in the finish. An elegant peated whisky.",99.0,88,48.3,1.0
1485,Gavin Smith,"This 2014 bottling of Ben Nevis illustrates how good the single malt can be with robust sherry cask maturation. Distilled in June 1998, it was filled into a fresh sherry butt and matured for 15 years before 582 bottles were released. Raisins, prunes, old polished leather, and roasted meat on the nose. The body is full, with the palate offering succulent dark berries, dates, raisins, and plain chocolate. Long and spicy in the finish, with cloves and rum raisin-flavored dark chocolate. £92",140.0,88,57.3,1.0
1486,Dave Broom,"Though sounding more like a character out of Asterix than a whisky, Authenticus is the code for the peated arm of the ever-expanding BenRiach portfolio. It’s the smoke that you notice first, typically Highland-style wood smoke with a light aromatic lift akin to smoked meat. It’s not a bludgeoning smoke however, because BenRiach’s inherent orchard fruit sweetness is there alongside touches of beeswax. In other words, it has maturity. The key here is balance and harmony. £124",195.0,88,46.0,1.0
1487,Dave Broom,"This new member of the core range is wholly from stock produced by the distillery’s new(ish) owner. It has a gentle, sweet, honeycomb nose, with some banana, a little malt, and lemon freshness. The palate shows light honey/honeysuckle at the start and is well balanced, with maltiness and a signature spicy finish adding a dry counterpoint to the sweetness from the cask and a distillate with good weight. Good price as well. Lovely.",50.0,88,43.0,1.0
1488,Gavin Smith,"As the name implies, this non-chill filtered expression was finished in Pedro Ximinez sherry butts. The nose offers sweet sherry, honey, malt, and lemon, while the palate yields more sherry, plain chocolate, honey, spicy toffee, and a hint of orange. More spicy toffee, plus drying oak in the medium-length finish.",100.0,88,46.0,1.0
1489,John Hansell,"This whisky combines the finer qualities of both the 18 year old and the 25 year old. It expresses the balance and purity of the 18 year old, while showing maturity found in the 25 year old. The lack of chill-filtering enhances the whisky’s vibrancy and, like all the Benromachs, it’s mouth-coatingly thick and malty.",160.0,88,58.6,1.0
1490,John Hansell,"The first 10 year old release containing whisky produced entirely by the new owners. I love the interplay here between the malt, sherry, and smoke, with all getting a chance to shine. A rich vanilla-tinged malty foundation, deep caramel, rhum agricole, an array of lush fruit and dark chocolate, along with grassy/hay notes, honeysuckle, subtle spice (cinnamon, anise), and lingering earthy smoke. A vast improvement from the “Origins” release last year. I would only make three changes to make this whisky even better (and elevate it to 90+ status): a couple more years on oak, bottling at 46%, and not chill-filtering it. Still, this is one of the best efforts from this distillery. Well done!",50.0,88,43.0,1.0
1491,Dave Broom,"Another example of the old ‘Strathspey’ style of whisky, which predates the lighter, more estery/floral style we have become accustomed to. Here, distillery weight and time work in tandem to give a nose that has slightly overripe orchard fruits, smoke, and Seville orange. The palate then heads into the hedgerows—hawthorn and currant jam—before a waxiness emerges. The finish reveals a mix of smoke and mint. All in all, an excellent dram. £425",610.0,88,43.0,1.0
1492,John Hansell,"Gold color. Citrus zest aromas and creamy sweet notes-reminiscent of lemon meringue pie-with subtle tropical fruit and marshmallow notes dancing throughout. This whisky has great balance and is fully mature at 12 yrs., which should be no surprise for a Lowland whisky. The palate delivers what the aroma promises, with a touch of honey up front, citrus and vanilla in the middle, and a delicate dryness on the finish. I've always admired Bladnoch-a whisky that needs to be better known-and this expression reinforces my opinion.",75.0,88,59.0,1.0
1493,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in Scotland’s most southerly distillery of Bladnoch in October 1992, this bottling has been matured in a refill hogshead, and 150 bottles have been allocated to the U.S. It presents a fresh nose, with initial herbal notes, turning to cornflakes and newly-mown hay. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with oat biscuits and milk chocolate. The finish is relatively short, with spicy custard, then a final fruit flourish.",130.0,88,56.9,1.0
1494,Gavin Smith,"The revival of Bladnoch Distillery in southwest Scotland continues, with the launch of 15 and 25 year old expressions to add to the NAS Samsara (reviewed winter 2016). Talia has been finished in new American oak casks. Sweet and floral on the nose, with violets, Jaffa orange, and fragrant fresh oak. Medium to full-bodied, with rich fruit notes, praline, malt, and finally, raisins and prunes. Dark oak in the long, mouth-drying finish.",385.0,88,49.2,1.0
1495,John Hansell,"The first Tempest to be imported to the U.S. Aged exclusively in first-fill bourbon casks. With the bourbon cask, and relatively young age, you can really feel all the Islay love. Bracing, with plenty of sea character, along with honeyed vanilla, citrus, floral notes (especially lavender), rumbling peat smoke, tobacco, and resinous oak on the finish.  A bit steep in price for a 10 year old, but very dynamic.",100.0,88,56.0,1.0
1496,Dave Broom,"A sweet start, then a sudden blast of fresh, menthol-like toothpaste (pleasant) before it dips into slightly decaying soft fruits (again, nice), a mashy note, then violet-accented smoke. Water adds some elegance and weight. This sweetness continues on the palate, where there’s toffee, raisin, ripe fruits, and slow-burning peatiness, fully integrated and ember-like on the back palate. The finish is all hot peppered mackerel. Recommended. (U.S. only)",120.0,88,58.4,1.0
1497,John Hansell,"Pale gold/straw color. Fresh, appetizing aroma and flavor of brine, delicate peat, gentle sweetness, and a touch of spice and seaweed. Medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Nicely balanced and clean, with a salty, dryish finish. This is a lovely, very appetizing expression of a distillery that has been closed and dismantled. (It was the original Clynelish distillery.) It is a very nice example of a northern Highland whisky, and expresses a great balance between sweetness and brine, youth and maturity. However, I would have liked to have seen it bottled at a higher strength.",65.0,88,43.0,1.0
1498,Dave Broom,"Part of an ongoing series, and the first appearance of Port Charlotte. This ain’t shy. Assertive with banana, roasted red pepper, paprika, and a hit of barbecued pork glazed with pomegranate molasses. The palate has blazing heat, but also oiliness and real density. The peat doesn’t so much rumble as sit there in a cloud: opaque, impenetrable. Even water cannot unlock it. Rooty and tarry, this is not a dram for the fainthearted. £65 (500 ml)",101.0,88,60.0,1.0
1499,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Peated whiskies definitely have a dropping off point where they become too old and tired, and the nose for this one would indicate it’s past its prime, with gravel, rubbery smoke, and raisin. On the palate it’s a different story, as ashy smoke combines with raisin and rancio, turning the peat age detriment into an asset. Strangely alluring, it’s like sitting on a park bench next to a weathered old man who ends up having a real tale to tell.  (U.S. only)",230.0,88,47.8,
1500,Jonny McCormick,"Dried peat smoke, a papery column of cigar ash, sizzling bacon fat, baked earth, and a shower of sea spray, coupled with hints of fresh peach and ripe fruits. The palate has a light, oily consistency ingrained with smokiness throughout, tasting of vanilla toffee, pick ‘n’ mix foam bananas, tangy citrus, and sweet tropical fruits, the whole arrangement given a peppery lift before succumbing to a late nuttiness. It’s not named after the Gaelic for smoky for nothing, you know.",66.0,88,46.0,1.0
1501,Gavin Smith,"This was matured in second-fill sherry casks and then spent 3 years in first-fill Pedro Ximénez butts. The nose features fruit and nutty milk chocolate, fudge, sultanas, and mixed candied peel. Lush, sweet sherry on the palate, with a carryover of fudge and sultanas from the nose. Long in the nutty, spicy finish, which offers nutmeg and peppery oak. (5,000 bottles)",99.0,88,54.3,1.0
1502,John Hansell,"Like the Clynelish 14 year old also reviewed in this issue, it is nice to see Diageo finally introduce official distillery bottlings of Caol Ila here in the U.S. (after being available in the UK for many years now). My suitcases were getting quite heaving on my return trips from Scotland. This is a splendid Coal Ila. It is wonderfully vibrant. Understandably, the immediate impact on the palate is the peat smoke, but there's so much else going on here, too: smoked olives, seaweed, salt and pepper, all placed on a gently sweet bed of toffee and vanilla fudge. Lingering smoke, olives, and seaweed on the finish.",50.0,88,43.0,1.0
1503,John Hansell,"Amber gold color. An exciting aroma-classic Islay. It is very phenolic, reminiscent of standing downwind of a peat kiln. Interwoven spice (especially pepper), seaweed, and sweet & sour notes add complexity. Light to medium in body, but quite oily. Nicely balanced flavors of peat smoke, seaweed, salt & pepper, all wrapped up in a gentle sweetness. Lingering peat smoke and spice on the finish. Yet another example of Caol Ila's fine pedigree. This bottling has great balance, and I especially enjoy how the smoke and sweetness marry together. My only criticism is that it is a bit soft for Caol Ila. I would love to try this whisky at 46 or 50% ABV, which would give it a bit more guts.",85.0,88,40.0,1.0
1504,John Hansell,"A rounded and mature affair. The 25 years in oak has made it a bit more refined (and drier on the palate) compared to younger expressions. All the classic Caol Ila notes are stillthere-mustard, seaweed, olives, damp peat, salt and pepper. A touch of vanilla wafer, anise, smoked almonds, and tarry rope add complexity. Those of you who prefer Ardbeg 17 over the 10, and Laphroaig 15 over the 10, will be attracted to this whisky when compared to Caol Ila's younger siblings. But at $225, it's an expensive date, isn't it?",225.0,88,59.4,1.0
1505,John Hansell,"Bottled in 2004 and still in circulation. A very traditional Caol Ila. Not a heavy-bodied whisky, but it throws a strong punch. Notes of tarry rope infused with seaweed and brine, all on an oily, malty, vanilla foundation. Throw in some orchard fruit, Manzanilla olive, black licorice stick, and soot, with brine and Tellicherry pepper on the finish. Clean, fun, and dynamic.",170.0,88,50.0,
1506,John Hansell,"Caol Ila makes unpeated whisky for blenders, but it rarely gets bottled as a single malt. Here’s a very revealing opportunity to find out what Caol Ila tastes like without the smoke. Good viscosity and rather sweet, showing thick, honeyed vanilla, gobs of fruit (lemon drops, lime tart, ripe Bartlett pear, kiwi), mint jelly, and cut grass. Its sea influence finally emerges towards the finish with brine and just a hint of seaweed. Bruichladdich and Bunnahabhain are now bottling peated whiskies, and Caol Ila does just the opposite. This is an interesting diversion, but I am missing the added dimension of peat smoke in this Caol Ila.",60.0,88,65.8,1.0
1507,Dominic Roskrow,"This is to be a permanent addition to the core Caol Ila range, but it will raise a few eyebrows, completely ignoring the current peat battle between Ardbeg and Bruichladdich and heading off into an altogether more refined and delicate direction. This is a dignified and complex malt, which doesn’t give everything up immediately. There’s soft pear and guava on the nose, and the trademark oiliness and distinctive peat are there, but there’s a buttery quality, too, as well as some brine and spice, apple pip, and traces of aniseed. You get a sense of its age late on, with some oaky tannins and sharper spice, but overall this is an unhurried, complex, and sweet whisky with just enough peat to keep it honest. Very impressive. (Limited general releases, excluding the U.S.)",205.0,88,43.0,1.0
1508,Dave Broom,"Unusual, insofar as this is the one chance a year that drinkers get to try Caol Ila’s other expression: the unpeated version, which — and here’s a bit of history for you — helped save the distillery during the lean period of the whisky loch in the early 80s. Rather than this just being Caol Ila with the peat stripped out, the team made  it in a different fashion — but there are still hints of commonality. 
For example, the grassy note that usually lies beneath the smoke is the lead aroma here, and it’s not any old grass, but wet grass — like skidding on a football (soccer) field. The mind keeps looking for smoke, but apart from a hint of birch smoke (which could come from the (refill) cask), it’s whistle-clean and fruity, and with a touch of water, fills with an aroma of toffee popcorn, custard, and pears. 
The palate continues in this light fashion with melon balls and fruit cocktail. This potentially bland fleshiness is given a perkiness thanks to the high alcohol and, again, a jag of acidity. Bizarrely, on the finish, I pick up slight saltiness. A fun dram.",79.0,88,57.6,1.0
1509,Gavin Smith,"This unpeated version of Caol Ila was matured in refill American oak hogsheads. The nose is quite reticent, with subtle vanilla and milk chocolate notes. Big, fizzy-sweet fruit notes on the palate, with caramel, rock pools, hot spices, plain chocolate, and very mild wood smoke. Bubble gum and peppery chocolate in the medium-length finish.",100.0,88,59.8,
1510,John Hansell,"Caperdonich is always a challenge to find. This one is aged in a sherry cask. One would fear that slumbering away for 35 years in a sherry cask would completely dominate this whisky’s profile. Not this whisky. As you would expect, it is nicely matured, but it is surprisingly clean and well rounded, too! Exotic notes of dried fruits, sultana, subtle (but viscous) honey, sandalwood, and a potpourri of spice (especially cinnamon, anise, ginger). Clean, subtly spicy finish. Slowly sip and savor its delicate pleasures.",165.0,88,43.0,1.0
1511,Gavin Smith,"Darkness! is a range of cask strength single malts which have been finished for 3 months in 50-liter first-fill oloroso or Pedro Ximénez casks. Waxy on the nose, with dates, prunes, cherries, cocoa powder, window polish, and finally vanilla. Warm and spicy on the palate, with sweet sherry, hot chocolate, intense tropical fruit notes, and cloves. The fruit becomes more citric in the finish; nutty, with clove oil. £75",126.0,88,54.9,1.0
1512,Gavin Smith,"This Clynelish is notable as the first no age statement Special Release, and maturation took place in refill European and bodega European oak casks, along with first-fill, refill, and rejuvenated American oak casks. The nose is fresh and salty, with olives, pine, and lemongrass, then fruit notes ranging from citric to sweet. Oily on the palate, with those same citric and sweet fruits as the nose, plus cayenne pepper and vanilla. Spicy citrus fruits in the drying finish.",800.0,88,54.9,1.0
1513,Gavin Smith,"The maturation regime of this Clynelish involves first-fill American oak barrels, rejuvenated and refill American oak hogsheads, plus bodega and refill European oak butts. The minimum age in the assemblage is 15 years, and 2,946 bottles are available.  A complex, perfumed nose, with scorched grass, developing vanilla fudge, and freshly-peeled orange. Classic Clynelish waxiness on the palate, with toffee, more orange, peach, digestive biscuits, cinnamon, and developing pepper. The lengthy, creamy finish features chocolate-coated orange candy and ginger.",815.0,88,56.1,1.0
1514,John Hansell,"Those who are fond of ripe, sherried whiskies will enjoy this new 15 year old. It’s aged entirely in sherry casks. The sherry is nicely layered (but not sappy or cloying) and the Dalmore spirit is big enough to handle it. Lush fruit, richly textured and fleshy, with a warming spice impact on the finish. Orange marmalade, glazed citrus, and key lime pie are enveloped by sweet toffee/molasses notes, and spiced with cinnamon, clove, ginger, and subtle chocolate. Soothing and restorative in nature. Good for after dinner — or with a cigar.",80.0,88,40.0,1.0
1515,John Hansell,"Master Blender Richard Paterson’s excellent adventure. This whisky consists of Dalmore aged in a wide variety of casks, including cabernet sauvignon, madeira, Matusalem sherry, marsala, port, and bourbon. This diversity shows in the whisky’s complexity and unique flavor profile. There’s a lot going on in here. Very rich, but balanced with oak spice and gripping resin (especially on the finish). Sweet layers of toffee, molasses, and vanilla fudge provide a foundation for red plum, ripe red raspberry, black cherry, blueberry, orange marmalade, kiwi, grape skin, and toasted almond. A very busy whisky which requires a good dose of mental participation to really appreciate it and sort all the flavors out. In this regard, very much like Glenmorangie Signet.",200.0,88,40.0,1.0
1516,Gavin Smith,"The Dalmore Cromartie was distilled in 1996 and has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The release is limited to 7,500 bottles. A floral nose with cocoa powder and warm leather, along with hand-rolling tobacco and gingery, citrus notes. Rich and elegant sherry notes on the palate, with soft, smoky treacle and dark chocolate-covered orange candy. The finish is long and spicy, majoring on cinnamon, with more dark chocolate, overripe orange, and a hint of licorice. £100",156.0,88,45.0,1.0
1517,Gavin Smith,"Just 450 bottles of this year’s offering are available. Aged in a mixture of Madeira, muscatel, and port casks, with a final spell in first-fill bourbon barrels. Warm caramel, spiced orange, peach blossom, and black pepper on the complex nose. Nicely textured on the palate; initially fondant-sweet, then nutmeg, Jaffa orange, ginger, and milk chocolate emerge. Relatively lengthy in the finish, with sultanas, leather, a hint of plain chocolate, and lingering black pepper. £150",229.0,88,48.0,1.0
1518,Gavin Smith,"Following on from its limited edition 21 year old release, Dalmore has introduced a 30 year old expression, with 888 numbered bottles being available. Matured in a mix of Matusalem oloroso and Amoroso oloroso sherry butts sourced from the Gonzales Byass bodega. The nose is slightly meaty, with coffee, sherry, and stewed apple. Supple on the palate, with dark, spicy orange, black currant cordial, and marzipan. Spicy tannins kick in during the very long, fruity, finally mouth-drying finish.",,88,45.0,
1519,John Hansell,"Lush and fruity-the sherry cask aging is obvious-and it is balanced beautifully by the dry, spicy oak notes. Through all this, there’s inviting notes of ginger, raisin, and a whiff of peat. One of the best Glen Ord whiskies I’ve tasted.",100.0,88,43.0,1.0
1520,Gavin Smith,"The latest single cask expression of 1991 Glen Scotia from Wemyss Malts has been matured for 22 years in a sherry butt, which yielded 807 bottles. The nose provides sherry and cigar boxes, cherries, sultanas, raisins, orange peel, plum pudding, and finally warm leather. Full bodied, with sherry on the palate, plus brine, dried fruit, bitter coffee, and polished old, dark oak. Medium to long in the fruity finish, with salt, plain chocolate, and wood polish notes. £105",95.0,88,46.0,1.0
1521,John Hansell,"The first single cask release of GlenDronach for the U.S. by the new owners, and a nice one at that. Silky in texture, polished, and clean on the palate, with light toffee, treacle, cherry bonbon, orange-soaked date nut cake, and chocolate-covered raisin. Never cloying, like some heavily-sherried whiskies can be. Silky, soothing finish. Surprisingly soft and youthful for its age. (A Park Avenue Liquor exclusive.)",135.0,88,58.7,1.0
1522,Gavin Smith,"Initially matured in recharred puncheons, then transferred for an unspecified period into virgin American oak casks. The nose offers icing sugar and soft toffee, vanilla, clementine, and wood varnish. More icing sugar, with orange and fudge on the palate, plus wood spice and an herbal note. Fruity through the finish, while spice builds, with a hint of aniseed at the close. An interesting alternative to the classic sherry-rich GlenDronach style.",90.0,88,46.0,1.0
1523,Dave Broom,"A refill sherry hoggie has given a classic walnut color, and indeed notes of that nut as well. Here’s Glenfarclas at its most dense, with savory, sun-dried tomato-like edges and sandalwood. The mouth is elegant with a little heat, the sherry giving roasted almond, sweet plump dried fruits, and dried flowers. Water brings out lightly gripping tannins (but, again, not aggressively) and good layering. Similar to the ’87. £285",480.0,88,45.4,1.0
1524,Gavin Smith,"Glenglassaugh initially imported Massandra wine casks from the Crimea in 2010 for finishing purposes, and that was the first time the winery had allowed its wood to be exported. In 2014, two Massandra cask finishes were released. Distilled in 1978, the Madeira-finished nose yields dates, sultanas, stewed fruit, caramel, a hint of smoke, and spices. Smooth on the palate, with apricots, cocoa powder, oak, and lots of spice development. The softly-oaked finish is lengthy, citric, and spicy. £395",665.0,88,41.7,
1525,Gavin Smith,"Glenglassaugh has launched its first cask-finished whiskies, matured for an unspecified period in first- fill American oak casks before finishing for up to 2 years in secondary casks. This is the pick of the quartet of expressions, with a nose of fragrant, fruity smoke, hand-rolling tobacco, and new leather. Red berry fruits and woodsmoke feature on the palate, while the finish offers gentle peat smoke, cinnamon, and black pepper. £60",81.0,88,46.0,1.0
1526,Gavin Smith,"Probably the most highly-regarded malt in the regular Glengoyne lineup, the 17 year old represents a direct progression from its younger siblings. According to the distillers, “The balance has artfully changed. A more concentrated palate of flavors has emerged…” Citrus and cedar notes on the slightly grassy nose, with a hint of plain chocolate. Medium in body, with more plain chocolate notes, plus raisins, orange, vanilla, and malt. Lengthy in the finish, with milky coffee, sherry, leather, and citrus spice.",70.0,88,43.0,
1527,Gavin Smith,"This variant of Glengoyne replaces the popular 17 year old as part of an overhaul of the core range, and the maturation regime has included what the distillers describe as “a generous proportion of first-fill sherry casks.” Milk chocolate, vanilla, melon, and grapefruit on the nose, with burgeoning dry sherry and fruitcake. The palate is rich and well rounded, with cinnamon and ginger, almonds, orange marmalade, sweeter sherry, and caramel. Lingering spices and easy-going oak in the lengthy finish.  £70",109.0,88,43.0,1.0
1528,John Hansell,"Very fragrant. Spicy too, with notes of honeyed vanilla, peaches in cream, butterscotch, cinnamon, licorice (red and black), light nuttiness, and toasted oak on the finish. Nice mouthfeel, well-balanced, and quite rich for such an elegant whisky.",160.0,88,53.9,1.0
1529,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. Exotic aroma of tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), vanilla, and honey. Medium bodied and firm. On the palate: honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit up front, becoming dry, with subtly complex spice notes. Deep, dry, lingering finish.",95.0,88,45.9,1.0
1530,John Hansell,"Lively on the nose for its age (and on the palate too -- the tell-tale oak emerges only towards the end). Notes of creamy vanilla, barley sugar, coconut, pineapple, and general citrus notes throughout. Dried spices (especially cinnamon) kick in mid-palate and continue into a lengthy, dry, polished oak finish.",160.0,88,40.0,1.0
1531,John Hansell,"Once again Lorne Mackillop demonstrates his talent for selecting whiskies with beautiful balance. This time it’s with a well-aged Glenlivet. Sure, it shows many of the notes that I often find in Glenlivet (Speyside elegance, peachy vanilla, tropical fruit, floral and honeyed-malt notes), but I’m also picking up more subtle notes: dark chocolate, licorice root, dark fruit, perhaps even charcoal (especially on the finish), making the whisky a bit more complex and curiously attractive.",180.0,88,43.0,1.0
1532,Dave Broom,"There’s no doubt that this is from Glenlivet; there’s still that pure combination of fruit and flowers, now given a little nudge toward a more concentrated expression: the flowers are dried and heathery, the fruits tinned pineapple, windfall apples. An added cedar/nutmeg note adds to the complexity. Liquorous and tongue-clinging with custard tart notes before the autumn fruits come through. A sense of the curtains being drawn and a settling in for the winter. Recommended.",100.0,88,43.0,1.0
1533,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. This whisky is finished off in new oak, and it certainly shows. There are lots of complex wood spices in this whisky, and it is intensely deep and mature for such a young age. There’s a firmness to the whisky that’s very appealing. It is exciting too, with notes of toasted oak, vanilla, and a hint of dark chocolate.",57.0,88,43.0,1.0
1534,John Hansell,"This is unlike any Glenmorangie I’ve ever tasted. It’s a very textural, visceral whisky -- partly due to the chocolate malt, partly due to the casks used. It’s dark in color for a Glenmorangie, and viscous on the palate, with interwoven notes of dark chocolate, ground coffee, pot still rum, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg), followed by dry polished leather, tobacco leaf, and a roasted walnut finish. This is a fun whisky, and earns bonus points for being unique in flavor. But I think its dry, slightly assertive finish detracts from what otherwise is a thrilling, dynamic journey.",205.0,88,46.0,1.0
1535,John Hansell,"Glenmorangie enters the world of peated whiskies (like everyone else these days it seems — not that I’m complaining). Richly textured layers of sweetness (vanilla, toffee, milk chocolate), fruit (tangerine, orchard fruit — especially ripe cherry), roasted nuts, wild morels, a hint of menthol, and gentle smoke. Certainly entertaining, even if the whisky doesn’t always seem to know what it wants to be. The soft sweetness mid-palate is balanced nicely by dried spice and smoke on the finish. Curiously enjoyable.",80.0,88,46.0,1.0
1536,Gavin Smith,"Previously offered as a 12 year old, it now has an extra three years of secondary maturation, after a decade in ex-bourbon casks. The ‘finishing’ casks are ex-Sauternes barriques. Lemonade, icing sugar, vanilla, nougat, and maple on the nose. Progressively sweeter. Rich and sweet on the palate, notably fruity, with spicy orange and brittle toffee. Medium length finish, with milk chocolate-coated ginger and lingering toffee. £39",62.0,88,46.0,1.0
1537,Gavin Smith,"Artein is the third release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition range, with ‘artein’ being Gaelic for stone. The expression comprises two-thirds 15 year old and one-third 21 year old whisky, finished in ‘Super Tuscan’ wine casks. Briefly pear drops, then vanilla on the nose, with developing peaches and apricots, shot through with mild ginger. Viscous, mouth-coating, intense, dark fruits, spice, aniseed, and late onset of cloves and blackcurrant cough medicine on the palate. The finish is fruity, long, and herbal.",80.0,88,46.0,
1538,Gavin Smith,"Tùsail—apparently Gaelic for ‘originary’—is the sixth release in Glenmorangie’s Private Edition collection. It was distilled using floor-malted Maris Otter winter barley, once ubiquitous in the British brewing industry but now practically a rare breed. Oily on the nose, notably linseed, then becoming more floral. Cinnamon, ginger snaps, and faint new leather. Viscous on the palate, with poached pears, cloves, nutmeg, and polished oak. Drying, nutty oak in the finish. £76",111.0,88,46.0,1.0
1539,Gavin Smith,"Tarlogan is the third and most recent release in Glenmorangie’s Legends Collection. Some of the component whisky had been matured in virgin oak casks, while the remainder was aged in bourbon barrels. A hint of freshly-dug soil on the very early nose, then toffee apples, malt, and vanilla kick in. The smooth palate focuses on coconut and more vanilla, with kumquat and lime. Almonds and vanilla in the mildly spicy finish. (Travel Retail exclusive)",82.0,88,43.0,1.0
1540,Gavin Smith,"Part of Glenmorangie’s Legends collection, this was finished in casks that previously held sweet French white wines. Sweet red berries on the somewhat shy nose, with developing low-key honey and vanilla. Nicely textured, with a palate of honey, caramel, milk chocolate, shortbread, and lots of lively spice.

1541,John Hansell,"The newest expression from the 1990s. Heavier, richer, and more ripe that the 1987 Vintage reviewed above.

1543,John Hansell,"Richer, thicker, and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit, sticky toffee pudding, and nuts, with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage.",125.0,88,43.0,1.0
1544,Dave Broom,"The nose is redolent with the smells of autumn jam — slowly stewing dark berry fruits — but there’s a hint of hazelnut adding a drier edge alongside some waxed paper. As it opens, out comes argan oil. This constantly changing array of aromas is very Glenrothes, as is the vanilla lift when water is added, which comes with added cordite. The palate is very sweet, filled with fruit syrups and even some dried rose petal. The finish, long. £79",124.0,88,58.6,1.0
1545,Dave Broom,"The hue is deep amber and the nose is equally resonant and rich. This is Glenrothes in its most muscular guise, so that while you have the normal layers of fruity complexity, there is an extra weight. Think of citrus peels, sticky dates, walnuts, and fruit leather. The palate is soft and rolling with light tannin. For me, it’s at its best au naturel.",140.0,88,43.0,1.0
1546,Dave Broom,"As befits an elder of the church, this has a serious attitude, which with the youngest component being 18 years old isn’t a surprise. Full-bodied, but with elegance, not bludgeoning power, this is a refined Rothes: malted barley, creamy oak, oxidative depths. Sweet with stewed plums and red fruit. The palate is unctuous with little hints of geranium and becomes slightly funky with water, though I’d go neat to get the full effect of bitter orange and sweet honeycomb. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €99",158.0,88,43.0,1.0
1547,Dave Broom,"The youngest of the Manse Brae triumvirate, and also the freshest. Here is Rothes at its liveliest, with sweet cereal and the typical spiciness of the distillery undercut by citrus peels, dessert apples, and hot malted milk. On the tongue it is quite delicate, but it is how it behaves mid-palate which is the killer, just stopping and allowing the fruits to liquefy in the center of the tongue. Fantastic price as well.

1554,John Hansell,"Like “Superstition,” this is a peated expression of Jura. Compared to Superstition, Prophecy seems richer, heavier, sweeter, deeper, leafier, with more tarry notes. I’m also picking up more spice (cinnamon, anise, dark chocolate) and some fruit (lime, mandarin orange, green apple), with a subtle yet intriguing suggestion of burnt popcorn. Prophecy is also bottled at 46% and not chill-filtered—which I think brings out more subtle nuances and texture in the whisky. The only tradeoff is that I’m picking up less of the Jura spirit and less sea characteristics. But this is a small tradeoff, considering how much more you’re getting with Prophecy. Promoted as a limited annual release.",70.0,88,46.0,1.0
1555,Gavin Smith,"This expression of Jura is by leading London wine and spirits merchant Berry Bros. & Rudd, and was bottled in the company’s Berry’s Own range at 35 years of age after maturation in sherry hogshead #889.

Classic leafy, smoky notes, along with some tarry rope, emerge on the palate and maintain a steady keel as they work their way through an ocean of vanilla malt. Lingering finish of burning embers. Certainly an enjoyable Lagavulin, but I still like the standard 16 year old better. It’s hard to improve on a classic.",500.0,88,52.6,1.0

1558,Dave Broom,"It’s a brave person who tries to persuade a malt like Lagavulin to go into a different direction. Indeed, even PX casks, from the sweetest fortified wine of all, can’t fully obscure the distillery’s character, just give it a raisined coating. The creosote turns to tar and licorice, while there’s Syrah-like sootiness, and damson. This release is slightly less sweet than in the past and is the better for it, though I still prefer my Lagavulin relatively ‘naked.’",77.0,88,43.0,1.0
1559,Dave Broom,"Light in color it may be, but this is no wimp. The nose goes straight to the shore with mineral and salt, but it’s also sweet, which allows it to be fresh, lively, yet balanced. The palate delivers some menthol, bay laurel, more brininess, a hint of malt, and Parma violet. Everything remains very breezy, with peat smoke being blown from a kiln into salt-laden air. I prefer it to the 12 year old and the price is fantastic.",65.0,88,48.0,1.0

A sweetness stays with the whisky throughout to help balance the peat smoke.",60.0,88,45.0,1.0
1562,Dave Broom,"Big smoke. Smoked fish, in fact, with some linked oily elegance, along with touches of hot tar and a cooked agave quality, adding a slightly sour/sweet element; then come poached pear and pepper. The palate is rootier, but always with this deep, clinging texture. As it moves it sweetens briefly, then comes creosote. Water gives the sweetness more space before the big phenols come powering back. It’s a barbecue in your mouth. Classic Laphroaig, in fact. £91",142.0,88,48.4,1.0
1563,John Hansell,"Also known as St. Magdalene, this Lowland distillery which closed down for good in 1983 is becoming increasingly more difficult to find. And when one does become available, it will be pushing 20 years old or older, like this one. When young, Linlithgow often exhibits a freshness and drinkability, with a gentle maltiness and often hay or grassy notes for complexity. How does this older one fare? Quite well, actually. I was concerned that this whisky would have too much oak influence, given how old it is and how delicate the whisky can be. While those years in a hogshead add some dry spicy notes, they are never excessive. Instead, they add a complexity that blends in nicely with notes of creamy malt, vanilla, lemon gum drops, grass and hay. I am particularly impressed by the evolution of flavors on the palate and the length and depth of its dry, spicy finish. Certainly one of the best Linlithgows to come onto the market.",135.0,88,,1.0
1564,John Hansell,"One of the better bottlings from this Lowland distillery which closed in 1983. Velvety and slightly oily in texture, and fragrant. The whisky is balanced, the flavors clean, with no hint of excessive oak. Bourbon cask-aging offers up notes of vanilla wafer, along with coconut cream, honey, and a touch of caramel. Bright fruit (lemon meringue, pineapple, apricot) keeps the whisky lively, and suggestions of hay and linseed offer continued entertainment. Nutty, toasted oak finish. If you are looking for a Linlithgow (AKA St. Magdalene) to purchase before the whisky becomes impossible to find, I can recommend this one.",210.0,88,46.0,1.0

1566,Gavin Smith,"Like its elder sibling, Loch Lomond 12 year old is presented in non-chill filtered form, and in this case, matured in a mix of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. Ripe apricots, vanilla, and a suggestion of peat smoke on the nose.  The full palate offers oranges and pears, plus developing spicy malt and mild peatiness. Long in the finish, with spicy fruit notes. Drying, with subtle tannins.",55.0,88,46.0,1.0
1568,Gavin Smith,"This 11 year old bottling of Longrow from Springbank distillery was matured for seven years in refill bourbon casks before being filled into cabernet sauvignon hogsheads for a final four years. 9,000 bottles are available. The nose offers buttery smoked haddock, coal tar soap, citrus fruit, and new leather, with background notes of soft peat. Mouth coating, with rich peat on the palate, plus fruity spice and developing licorice notes. Long in the finish, with persistent peat smoke and, finally, red currants. £50",79.0,88,52.1,1.0
1569,John Hansell,"Quite fresh and lively for its age and loaded with fruit. You’ll find bright fruit (tangerine, passion fruit, lemon) followed by subtle, sweeter fruit (coconut, honeydew melon, banana, and apple crumb pie). Resinous, minty oak notes and a hefty viscosity give the whisky some structure, while floral notes (lavender, rose petals) and gentle vanilla expose a softer side to the whisky. Dry, oak finish.",230.0,88,52.4,1.0
1570,John Hansell,"The whisky is quite fruity (green grape, orange, tangerine, and dark cherry), with balancing notes of vanilla, roasted nuts, and a hint of peat. Dry, lightly spicy finish that lingers. It is complex and nicely balanced for a whisky of this age. Still, I feel the 15 year old Fine Oak edition is better and, at $65, one-tenth the cost.",650.0,88,43.0,1.0
1571,Dave Broom,"When approached from light to rich, you can see how the driver of the range is oxidation rather than just the addition of wood. Here are stewed black cherries, red plums, and blueberries, but with the purity and freshness of Amber and Gold. The mental image is of a country house in autumn: clay on boots, candle wax, resin, allspice, peels, those perfumed fruits, and the whiff of an artist’s palette. The tannins are supple. Best with water on the side. £66",103.0,88,43.0,1.0
1572,Dave Broom,"Bottled as 350 ml twin-pack along with the American oak version, this is deeply resinous, with clove, shoe leather, high-grade engine oil—an Aston Martin workshop, not a back alley garage—alongside dried fruits. Similar in tone to some old Caribbean rums with liqueur chocolate and Friar’s Balsam. The tannins yield slightly, showing chicory and raisin. ‘Old style’ Macallan, and another which, while strong, is best neat. £350",567.0,88,55.7,1.0
1573,Gavin Smith,"Released exclusively for the U.S., this is the first bottling in an annual series celebrating what Macallan terms its “…unrivalled commitment to the mastery of wood and spirit.” Matured in oloroso sherry-seasoned American and European oak casks. Confident Christmas cake aromas, plus quite assertive oak. Honey, toffee, vanilla, nutmeg, ginger, and lively oak on the palate. Gingery wood notes in the medium-length finish.",89.0,88,58.4,
1574,John Hansell,"This whisky shows the true potential of Mortlach -- and at a youthful age, too! Quite fragrant and very complex on the nose and palate. Chewy toffee with almonds, vanilla fudge, ripe barley, and nougat, with underlying pit fruits, dried spice, and a hint of leather on the finish. Very fulfilling.",65.0,88,46.0,1.0
1575,Gavin Smith,"This is the second travel retail-exclusive expression of Old Pulteney to use the registration of a Wick fishing vessel in its name, in this case the Isabella Fortuna, a herring drifter dating from 1890. This expression bears no age statement and was matured in bourbon casks. Floral and fragrant on the nose, with honey, vanilla, zest of lemon, and a hint of salt. The palate features fresh fruit salad, coconut, and sherbet liveliness. Summery. Medium length in the spicy finish. £35 (1 liter)",55.0,88,52.0,1.0
1576,Gavin Smith,"WK217 is the latest in Pulteney’s Travel Retail-exclusive range of releases named after the registrations of fishing vessels. This expression has been matured in a mix of Spanish and American oak sherry butts. Fig rolls, black treacle, sultanas, and a hint of cinnamon on the nose. Finally, milk chocolate. Smooth and oily on the palate, with soft spices, before deeper and darker sherry notes arrive. The finish is relatively long, with sherry and spice, then final spiky licorice notes. £40 (liter)",62.0,88,46.0,1.0
1577,Gavin Smith,"Navigator honors Old Pulteney’s seafaring heritage and promotional links with matters marine. The expression carries no age statement, is non-chill filtered, and has been matured in a mixture of bourbon and sherry casks. The nose features vanilla, sherry, American cream soda, ginger, orange peel, and cocoa powder. Complex. Mouth-tingling spices: ginger and nutmeg on the palate, with more oranges, and cocoa. Dries slowly, slightly powdery, with persistent citrus fruit, and a hint of brine. Value Pick.",65.0,88,46.0,1.0
1578,Gavin Smith,"An unusual vintage bottling of Old Pulteney, in that maturation occurred in a mix of American bourbon casks and Spanish sherry casks that previously held heavily-peated whisky. The nose opens with a whiff of ozone; then lemon, vanilla, and coconut appear, along with fleeting wood smoke. Intense tropical fruitiness merges with milk chocolate, lemon sorbet, and lively spices on the palate. Spicy milk chocolate with a citric and softly peaty tang in the finish.",200.0,88,46.0,1.0
1579,Gavin Smith,"Old Pulteney’s 40 year old comprises spirit from three sherry hogsheads and one bourbon barrel. Just 493 bottles of the distillery’s oldest expression to date have been released, offered at cask strength and not chill filtered. The nose is soft and fragrant, with peaches in syrup, toffee, cinnamon, and aerosol wood polish. Early intense orchard fruits on the palate, then nutmeg, cinnamon and black coffee. Long in the finish, with spicy oak tannins and Seville orange. Notably drying.",2280.0,88,51.3,
1580,Gavin Smith,"This 2017 release spent 22 years in bourbon casks before a final 3 years in oloroso sherry Spanish oak butts. Bright fruits on the nose: orange, lemon, and lime, with vanilla, soft toffee, and plain chocolate. Supple and silky on the palate, with sweet orange notes, more vanilla, and cocoa powder. Cocoa, nutmeg, dry sherry, and wood spices in the lengthy finish. (450 bottles)",600.0,88,46.0,1.0
1581,Gavin Smith,"This refill sherry butt-matured, cask strength variant of the Lowland classic Rosebank was distilled in December 1990. Floral and fruity on the nose.

The finish offers gentle oak and lots of spice.",170.0,88,54.0,1.0
1582,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1992, a year before Rosebank fell silent, this 21 year old expression was matured in refill American oak casks. 4,530 bottles have been released. The fragrant nose yields milk chocolate, peaches, apricots, nutmeg, and toffee bonbons. Spicy and mildly herbal on the palate, with icing sugar and a suggestion of dark chocolate.

1583,Gavin Smith,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.
Richer and more complex than its younger sibling, with waxy peel, glacé cherries, sherry, sultanas, and custard. Silky smooth in the mouth, with marshmallows, milk chocolate, medium-sweet sherry, and stem ginger. Tingling spices allied to darkening chocolate and a touch of smoke in the medium to long finish. Finally, a fat, buttery note.",135.0,88,40.0,1.0
1584,John Hansell,"Very powerful and quite different from the 10 year old, 46% bottling reviewed below; this tastes as if it is taken entirely from bourbon oak-aged Springbank. There’s fresh brine, creamy vanilla, honey, and coconut throughout, and it lacks the waxed fruit nature of its sibling. Mouthcoating in texture, with a long appetizing briny finish. Very clean -- and quite polished too, for such a powerful whisky. My choice of the three.",75.0,88,50.0,1.0
1585,John Hansell,"Nice to see stocks distilled after the 1980s ‘silent period’ turning 18 years old. The sherry influence here is complementary, but not overpowering. Notes of toffee almond, vanilla fudge, chocolate-coated citrus, bramble, and candied ginger. Polished leather, dried spice, and a hint of brine on the finish dries it out nicely and keeps it interesting. Not quite as dynamic and complex as some of those legendary pre-1980s Springers, but it’s smooth, well-rounded, and more-ish.",190.0,88,46.0,1.0
1586,John Hansell,"A good dose of sherry here, but there’s plenty of Springbank character coming through too! Gobs of ripe, red berried fruit (strawberry, rhubarb, red currant, raspberry), especially on the nose, along with raisin. It’s all on a bed of blueberry pancakes, toffee, and fig cake. Coconut and brine emerge occasionally on the palate and linger on the finish. A very nice whisky, although I wonder what it would taste like with just a little less sherry influence?",160.0,88,46.0,1.0
1587,John Hansell,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

The freshest of the bunch, chock full of Springbank character. Light and lively. Floral, with plenty of fruit (green grapes, kiwi, apple tart) on a bed of honeyed malt. Nuttiness and brine emerge toward the finish, and linger.",100.0,88,55.3,
1588,Gavin Smith,"Springbank has released a limited edition of 9,000 bottles of whisky distilled in November 2001, matured in small casks (traditionally known as rundlets or kilderkins), and bottled in January 2012. The small casks have left an impression of accelerated maturity, with coal smoke, cloves, young oak, and caramel on the rich nose. The palate is big and bold, with a sprinkling of salt, then more youthful wood, milk chocolate, and honey, while the finish is long and slightly tarry. £57",89.0,88,49.4,
1589,Gavin Smith,"This is the seventh batch of 12 year old cask strength Springbank to appear, being bottled early in 2014. Some of the component whisky was matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose blends maritime notes with Christmas cake fruits, vanilla pods, and overt sherry. Viscous in the mouth, with cowsheds and soft peat smoke, plus spice, caramel, and a hint of sweet sherry. The no-holds-barred finish presents a big blast of smoke, root ginger, and freshly-dug peat. £45",76.0,88,52.3,1.0
1590,Gavin Smith,"This expression was distilled in 2003 and after undergoing a period of finishing in amoroso sherry casks it was bottled in 2014. Fleeting green apples on the nose, before sweetening with figs, sultanas, red berries, and chili. Peat smoke finally makes its presence felt. Full-bodied on the palate, with spicy smoke, dark chocolate, peaches, and Jaffa orange; the additional fruitiness courtesy of the amoroso cask influence. Long and softly smoky in the finish, with ginger and lingering fruit notes. £55",81.0,88,45.8,1.0
1591,Gavin Smith,"Like its Ledaig stablemate, this Tobermory is offered non-chill filtered at cask strength. Finishing occurred in manzanilla sherry casks. Orange marmalade, nutmeg, and developing vanilla on the nose. Full bodied, with a palate of citrus fruit and soft spices, aniseed, and developing tannins. Lingering in the finish, with spicy plain chocolate. Ultimately, the tannins fade and leave a fresh citric note.",160.0,88,53.8,1.0
1592,John Hansell,"Very similar in flavor profile to the Tomintoul 16, reviewed below, but better. The longer aging has provided extra character and depth. Also, on the palate, the caramel flavors are a bit darker (bordering on toffee) and the whisky’s finish is longer and a shade drier. It has aged gracefully, with no excessive woodiness. A whisky that reveals its charm slowly and subtly.",175.0,88,,1.0
1593,John Hansell,"The subtle sherry adds an additional level of complexity when compared to the standard 10 year old, taking Tomintoul to a new level. Rich and creamy, with well-balanced notes of toffee, vanilla fudge, toasted nuts, and elegant fruit. A surprisingly delicious whisky for 12 years old.",70.0,88,40.0,1.0
1594,John Hansell,"A new, beefed-up version of the 18 year old, with a higher alcohol level and (seemingly) more sherry influence. I must say that I really enjoyed the previous expression, rating it an 87 for its roundness and elegance. I like this one too, and its bold demeanor. Whether you like it or its predecessor comes down to preference and mood. Notes of toffee apple, pancakes drizzled with maple syrup, date nut cake, ripe fruit, and roasted nuts, all dusted with cinnamon, vanilla, and cocoa.",60.0,88,46.0,1.0
1595,John Hansell,"Aged in a refill sherry puncheon, and the sherry is evident in appearance and on the palate. Soft and sweet, with caramel-coated mixed nuts, toffee apple, rhum agricole, currant (red and black), plum, cinnamon, and surprising brisk mint (especially toward the finish). A pleasing, non-aggressive expression of a mature, sherried whisky. (Not available in the U.S.)£340",553.0,88,,1.0
1596,Gavin Smith,"Tomatin has introduced a permanently-available 36 year old expression, and the first batch comprises 800 bottles. Matured in a combination of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks, this expression has not been chill-filtered. Milk chocolate and vanilla on the early nose, with background apricots, malt, and ginger. Ultimately citrus fruit and sherry. Good mouth-feel, lively sweet fruits, cloves, and more ginger on the palate. Long in the finish, drying slowly to fruity licorice and plain chocolate.",780.0,88,46.0,1.0
1597,Dave Broom,"Is this bottled by Duncan Taylor or Ben & Jerry’s? Ludicrous amounts of white/milk chocolate and macadamia nut, with green fennel underneath. With water, it opens into dark chocolate chunks (see what I mean?) and cappuccino. One sip makes you worry you’re putting on weight, such is the thickness of its impact. Okay, it’s more about the wood rather than the distillery, but you can’t deny that it puts a smile on your face. Completely bonkers and somehow wonderful. £49",78.0,88,52.1,1.0
1601,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"While the aroma is tightly wound at first, it gradually reveals layers of brown sugar and warming spice, apple and pear fruits woven through with opulent toasted oak. The palate entry is soft and rounded but quickly picks up steam, with layers of biscuity malt, peppercorns, blackberry fruit, and a lovely salted butter note that brings nice balance to the finish. Fully mature, pleasingly complex, and it keeps getting better!",55.0,88,47.0,
1608,Dave Broom,"Bunnahabhain, along with Bowmore, is Islay’s greatest user of ex-sherry casks; a throwback to the days when it was part of Highland Distillers. Its rich, thick, and ginger-accented spirit matches the attention of European oak extremely well. In this red tea-colored example, you have resin, saddle soap, ginseng, and treacle toffee on the nose, and a fusillade of roasted spices on the palate before the finish reveals sweet gingerbread. A big huggable bear. £60",96.0,88,,1.0
1609,Gavin Smith,"Just 279 bottles of this 22 year old single cask Glen Scotia have been released by Wemyss Malts, with maturation taking place in a bourbon cask. Fleetingly, very sweet, crunchy apples on the nose, then caramel, milk chocolate, sherbet dips, plus a hint of brine. The palate is sweet and peppery, with spicy toffee, grapefruit, melon, and walnuts. The finish is medium in length, spicy, with table salt in the tail. £90",145.0,88,46.0,1.0
1610,Dave Broom,"Highly fragrant and citric, mixing dried and sweet orange peels, moist sultana fruitcake. Lightly malty with gentle nuances of fruit syrup. Pretty and elegant in the mouth, where there’s orange barley water, mint, and crystallized ginger on top of a thick, honeyed delivery before the classic ‘Rothes sweet spices come through. Only a drop or two of water is needed. Recommended. £117",188.0,88,46.0,1.0
1616,Dave Broom,"You’d hardy expect Kilchoman to be able to spare casks for independent bottlings, but somehow TWE’s Sukhinder Singh has persuaded Anthony Wills to part with one of his precious babies. It exhibits classic Kilchoman notes of clove and fresh scallop, backed with subtle peat, chamomile, and lint. With water, a typically young, peaty aroma of rubber develops (so drink it neat). It shows the huge potential of this distillery. £50 (500 ml)",80.0,88,59.7,
1617,Dave Broom,"A single oloroso cask bottling, so an interesting comparison with the Loch Gorm (see below). The cask has more of an influence here, with plummy fruits, fig rolls, and Medjool dates. The smoke is restrained and foggy, allowing some seashore breezes to come through. The palate reverses this, with the smoke rolling in first, then the soft dark and sweet fruits, treacle, and garam masala. Tannins are very soft. Kilchoman with heft. (637 bottles) £90",117.0,88,56.6,1.0
1618,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 2012, this was aged in casks sourced from the Douro Valley in Portugal. Quite reticent on the early nose, with developing strawberries, vanilla custard, new oak, and subtle smoke. The palate offers smoky red wine notes, with ashy peat, spices, and tingling black pepper becoming more apparent. Sweet cherry fruitiness lingers in the relatively long finish with prickly spices.",125.0,88,50.0,
1619,Gavin Smith,"Matured in bourbon casks, this expression offers a sweet, pleasing nose of honey, icing sugar, toffee bonbons, and orange peel. Medium-bodied, with barley sugar, soft oak, nectarine, and lychee. Vanilla and a return of honey in the medium-length finish.",40.0,88,40.0,1.0
1621,John Hansell,"Caramel and vanilla notes, with a peppering of spice (primarily cinnamon, but also evergreen, cocoa, teaberry, and nutmeg) and subtle roasted walnut, finishing dry, gritty, and spicy (from the grains and also the oak). Spicier and not as sweet when compared to its sibling Jim Beam Black, an eight year old. There’s certainly a lot going on here. A very “busy” and intriguing whiskey for exploring and discussing. (Exclusive to Travel Retail.)€30",47.0,88,44.5,2.0
1622,John Hansell,"“Extra-aged” bourbon finished in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. The third Distiller’s Masterpiece release, the previous two being over a decade ago. The PX sherry is certainly evident, with its lush, dark fruit (raisin, prune, ripe plum), marmalade, and
layered dark sugars (toffee, molasses, maple syrup). A peppering of spices (cinnamon, allspice, vanilla) and dry, resinous oak round out the palate. Certainly a mood whiskey. Perhaps with a cigar after dinner? (distillery only)",200.0,88,50.0,2.0
1623,John Hansell,"Nicely balanced, with interwoven soft vanilla, cinnamon, and citrus, all on a bed of light toffee and caramel. More subtle notes of marzipan, tropical fruit, and soft oak add complexity. Traditional in style, with a friendly demeanour. A good bourbon to have on hand, as it is very versatile. I would have preferred this bottled at 45-50%, but this will do just fine as it is. A new regular bottling.",40.0,88,43.0,2.0
1624,Lew Bryson,"Triticale is a rye-wheat hybrid, so I’m expecting a rye-wheater hybrid bourbon. What I get is a screamer: spicy slice of a nose, hot cinnamon and sawn dry oak. Surprisingly light in the mouth, which is putting a smile on my face. Oak races through this, a spine coated with sweet grain, spicy notes, a bit of creaminess, and as the oak wraps up, I realize: no real rye bitterness. Cool stuff, a very good one. Price is per 375 ml.",50.0,88,45.0,
1625,Fred Minnick,"Launched in 2015, this is a solid pick for the under-$30 club. Think butterscotch and caramel dripping over popcorn: the cooked sugars first, then corn kernels. Dulled spices, oak, vanilla, hints of saddle leather and earth. This isn’t complex or complicated, but the medium-to-long candy corn finish leaves me wondering about its status with two more years in the barrel. Of course, that would mean the price would go up, too.",23.0,88,50.0,2.0
1629,Gavin Smith,"As with its sherry wood-matured sibling, this 10 year old release comprises 9,000 bottles and was distilled using the same lightly peated malt and bottled without chill filtration. Lemongrass, a pinch of salt, wood smoke, and ginger snaps on the nose. Tropical fruits on the soft, slightly oily palate, with a slight underpinning of spicy smoke. Nutty, drying, with mellow spice in the finish.",60.0,88,46.0,1.0
1630,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 2004, this 11 year old sherry cask-matured expression from Glengyle in Campbeltown is one of two final releases under the Work in Progress banner. 6,000 bottles have been released. Fragrant wood fires, fruity old leather, damp tweed, sherry, malt, and autumn berries on the nose. The palate is oily, rich, and rounded, with zesty spice, then peaches in syrup and sweet smokiness. The spices persist. The finish is long and warming with chili, licorice, and worn leather.",60.0,88,46.0,1.0
1631,Gavin Smith,"After six ‘Work in Progress’ releases, Kilkerran from Glengyle Distillery has finally come of age with this core expression. It comprises 70% whisky from first-fill bourbon casks and 30% from sherry casks. Floral on the nose, with honey and a hint of brine, then peaty fruit notes develop. The palate is confident and oily, slightly earthy, with tinned peaches, black pepper, cinnamon, smoke, and a suggestion of medicine chests. The finish is relatively long, with pepper, licorice, and drying oak.",45.0,88,46.0,1.0
1632,Dave Broom,"The original Singleton, seemingly discarded as a single malt, rides back defiantly with this bottling. The start shows cherrystone, but there’s an immediate deepening into mature notes of roasted chestnut, varnish, and sweet leather, but always sufficient caramel sweetness to balance. The palate starts sweetly and any grip is dissolved with a drop of water, which also extends what otherwise is a quick fade. Old yes, oak yes, but layered and good.",359.0,88,54.7,1.0
1634,Davin de Kergommeaux,"In 2013, the cavernous warehouses of the Canadian Mist distillery in Collingwood, Ontario gave up a single fifty-barrel batch of 100% malted rye. It had been resting there since 1991. Sweet, with the familiar flavors of rye bread, a juicy, joyful thrum burbles to a silken smooth surface before diving deep again only to rebound with warming spices, white pepper, and a pithy citrus pull. Indulgently creamy, Collingwood 21 defines “smooth.” Rich, flavorful, and oh, so mellow.",70.0,88,40.0,4.0
1635,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1984, just a few months before the distillery closed, this was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. A whiff of early earthiness gives way to pear drops, honey, vanilla, and resin on the nose. Pears, pineapple, caramel, and vanilla on the slightly waxy, spicy palate. Slowly drying in the medium-length finish, with peppery licorice and a hint of char. (3,972 bottles)",,88,48.2,1.0
1636,Gavin Smith,"This bottling of triple-distilled Hazelburn comprises spirit produced in 2003 and matured in unusually small casks known as rundlets and kilderkins. Malt, chocolate, and honey figure on the nose, along with a contrasting marine note in the background. Unctuous and rich on the palate, with soft fruit, almonds, brittle toffee, and lots of spice. The finish is lengthy and earthy, with caramel and vanilla notes ultimately being superseded by oak and sea salt. £60",101.0,88,50.1,1.0
1637,John Hansell,"A robust Speysider — and very tactile too (clinging to the palate), but with no excessive oak. Vanilla and some dark chocolate notes along with coating (yet ironically dry-ish) honey notes. But its biggest flavor note is citrus — particularly lemon, along with some tangerine and a hint of pineapple — which helps to cut through the thickness. Good depth, with dried spice, polished oak, and a wisp of smoke on the finish. (Bottled in 2004, but only recently released to the U.S.)",200.0,88,50.0,
1638,Dave Broom,"These days the mighty Mortlach is a known quantity, but Diageo’s two other meaty sites—Benrinnes and Dailuaine—remain in the shadows. This is big, boisterous, and sherried, but there’s less of the gravy-browning elements you get from the other two; at Dailuaine it is fruit that is promoted alongside Seville orange, treacle, and the inevitable raisin and date. There are nods to PX sherry as well. Every bit as good as Mortlach.  £43",65.0,88,43.0,1.0
1639,John Hansell,"Very much in the Elijah Craig style: thick and chewy, with layers of toffee, molasses, and vanilla cream. Notes of caramel-nut fudge, cinnamon bun, and blackberry brandy keep it fun. There’s just the right amount of dried oak spice on the finish to round things out. Very good, solid, affordable bourbon. (Capital City Package exclusive.)",26.0,88,47.0,2.0
1641,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A single barrel release, selected by Julio’s Loch & K(e)y society, focused very much on wood. An oak-forward nose features old split wood, pencil lead, and rye spice. On the palate the balance with oak improves slightly from the addition of brown sugar, vanilla, and cherry. Oak intensifies in the mid-palate, keeping some semblance of balance with the sweet undertones, but oak is clearly the star. A dry oak finish is the exclamation point at the end of this riff on wood. Sourced whiskey. (Julio’s Liquors only)",60.0,88,45.0,4.0
1646,Lew Bryson,"This is 8 year old 100% rye Canadian whisky that Fremont Mischief distillery imports and bottles. Congratulations are due: the rye spice-vanilla aromas are strongly similar to their younger, own-make whiskey reviewed below. The extra age shows: this is Canadian-mellow, not a fiery American rye, even at 45%. All the spice is there, and the floral/grassy complexity, but there are more rich oak notes, and a high, arching finish that sustains the whiskey on the palate.",33.0,88,45.0,3.0
1647,Lew Bryson,"A nose of hot cereal with a dusting of dry cocoa and oaky vanilla, and hints of figs and sesame oil. The palate yields clean grains — a real crack of rye among them — and oak, dried apricot, unsweetened licorice, and a long finish of warming rich cereal. Strikingly clean and non-cloying for Canadian, sweet but not overdone. Good for mixing, but equally good for sipping; a nice end-of-day dram. (Sold as both Very Old and 18 Year Old.)",65.0,88,40.0,
1652,Lew Bryson,"Three batches of malt, smoked separately with peat, cherry wood, and beech. The nose is Islay-reminiscent peat, with some beech bacon under it, but the top is all cherry; very rewarding. For all the nose, the mouth is relatively mild; mostly juicy malt up front, then opening to the peat fire in the middle, the beech crowding around the sides, and the cherry floating overtop like a good pipe tobacco. Smooth, smoky finish. Compelling.",45.0,88,40.0,3.0
1653,Lew Bryson,"The .36 Small Caliber was one of the best young small-barrel bourbons I’ve ever had, so I was very much looking forward to this 3 year, 8 month old bottling from “traditional large barrels.” Aroma: like a 12 year old bourbon: oak spice, corn sweet. Not hot, spice and vanilla, smooth but oaky, with a light, flowing feel. A unique combination of youth and maturity that opens the “Texas whiskey” niche a bit wider. (Spec’s exclusive)",79.0,88,48.0,3.0
1654,Lew Bryson,"The U.S.-released Dark Batch is, if not the same whisky as the Canadian-released Dark Horse (both from Alberta Distillers), a very close cousin. It is dark; it’s 1% sherry, which brings the intense dried fruit notes along with cedar and a bright, pleasantly musky note. More Canadians should break the 80 proof barrier: this booms into the mouth, throwing wood, cereal, fruit, and sunshine around. Good to sip, bold in a cocktail, holds its own on ice, nice price.",30.0,88,45.0,4.0
1659,Lew Bryson,"Bitter, oily, medicinally minty rye in the nose, and a pleasant undercurrent of oaky vanilla. Brisk, hot rye mixes furiously with wood notes, pear and berry esters, and a light grainy sweetness; a madly busy whiskey that’s quite fun on the palate. The finish is minty and grassy, wrapped in oak, but somewhat quick. Interesting, and delicious.",40.0,88,46.0,3.0
1660,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Dry and mildly dusty on first nosing, with a touch of pine pitch and red cedar. Tingling peppery spices and barrel notes carry onto the palate, bringing a slightly bitter counterpoint to luscious crème brûlée. Vanilla and hints of real maple syrup nuance apple pie sprinkled with baking spices, ripe black fruits, and a toffeeish but clean finish. Complex and beautifully integrated. Labeled 12 years old, Onyx includes some older whisky as well. (Europe exclusive) €27",28.0,88,40.0,4.0
1664,John Hansell,"This first limited-edition Taylor release attempts to recreate the “sour mash” process used a century ago. Sweet on the nose and palate (fruit gumdrops, sweet corn, vanilla wafer). Spicy too (cinnamon, evergreen), and clinging on the palate. The sweetness is rescued late, with a firm, dry oak finish. Reminds me of an exhilarating rollercoaster ride that puts the brakes on at the end. Not the most balanced, but certainly distinctive.",70.0,88,50.0,2.0
1665,John Hansell,"The second release in the new Taylor line by Buffalo Trace, and the first single barrel offering. Similar in personality to the first release (a small batch offering), but a shade darker in color, flavor, and personality. A bit more intense, too, with more mouthfeel, and not as demure. A fair trade-off. Starts off sweet (rummy, burnt dark fruit, fig cake) then becomes dry, with dried spice, tobacco, toasted oak, and leather. Very exciting and distinctive.",60.0,88,50.0,2.0
1666,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"It would be easy to hate on this as bourbon, but taken merely as a whiskey, it’s compelling, original, and surprisingly well-knit. The nose betrays the smoke and sea of its Islay cask finish, while the palate offers more sweet vanilla, candied nuts, and citrus before circling back with distinct vegetal notes of seaweed and jalapeño. Perhaps bourbon is in the eye of the beholder.",60.0,88,43.0,3.0
1671,Fred Minnick,"The nose tickles with caramel, spice, vanilla, and earthiness, with just a hint of balsamic vinegar.  Warming. Coated with spices, ranging from cinnamon to allspice and from coffee to nutmeg. Eventually, patented caramel and vanilla, with a fun hint of cardamom. The long, enjoyable finish is earthy, but there’s an unwanted bitterness at the end that cannot be denied. If not for the bitter end, this would rate much higher.",37.0,88,45.0,2.0
1672,Lew Bryson,"Ages range from 4 to 16 year old whiskeys; seven types of cask, 100% malt (mashed at Sierra Nevada Brewing). Solid, hefty malt nose with fruit dressing and a fleeting hint of baking spices. A much weightier, more serious whiskey this year; the malt is meaty, savory, with an edge from the wine oak, and even a hint of brine toward the end. I miss last year’s balance and relaxed nature, though; there’s an air of trying too hard here. (3,000 bottles)",90.0,88,43.0,3.0
1673,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"A perfumed nose of lilac, mint, orange flower water, and powdery Sweethearts candy introduces this pretty whiskey, as distinctive tangerine citrus meets papaya and tropical flavors. The malty palate is broad, sweet, and pure, delivering some bubble gum and confectionery notes. Very enjoyable, and almost juicy in its fruit bomb of flavors.",500.0,88,41.0,3.0
1674,Davin de Kergommeaux,"With NAS, 12, and 18 year old versions long-established as Canadian favorites, Gibson’s master blender, Brian Kinsman (of Glenfiddich), turned his hand to an 8 year old specifically intended to be mixed with Coke. Why? That’s how 40% of Canadians prefer their whisky. Rich in dark rum notes, kola nuts, vanilla pods, and sweet rye, it bursts with ripe black fruits and sizzling hot spices. Sip slowly to uncover black licorice, a touch of tannin, and the classic Canadian hot, bitter pith finish. C$29",22.0,88,46.0,4.0
1675,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The trend to higher-proof Canadian whisky continues. This massive gem from Highwood shows us how that benefits the whisky drinker. Toffee and spicy rye on the nose become toffee and sizzling hot pepper on the palate. While toffee lurks in the shadows, a lingering oaky base begins to assert itself. Sweetness and pepper subside as the wood emerges with a complexity not even hinted at on the nose. Enjoy it neat; love it with ginger ale. (Canada only)",25.0,88,50.0,4.0
1676,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Taken slow and easy, this 100% corn whisky tells a story, one you have to suss out gradually. It’s big and flavorful with hints of sweet corn, cow barn, and spices, followed by peppermint, lime peel, lilacs, and oak. Then it turns fresh, creamy, and alive with invigorating pepper and just a smidgen of sweetness, blending lemon drops, vanilla, and barley sugar until the story resolves satisfyingly on your palate. (Canada only) C$40",40.0,88,40.0,4.0
1677,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This soft, fruity luxury is a stablemate to Corby’s Lot No. 40, and another resurrected member of the once-lost Canadian Whisky Guild. Hiram Walker’s distillery, where Pike Creek is made, is one of the largest in North America. However, the owner, Pernod-Ricard, encourages creativity and innovation as well as product reliability. Gingery dark fruits mingle with canned fruit and clean oak, while a peppery nuttiness lingers below soft red wine and white grapefruit. C$40",40.0,88,40.0,4.0
1678,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Pike Creek is all about creating a rich blend, then finishing it in barrels previously filled with other flavorful spirits. Standard versions feature Port and rum finishes. This 21 year old edition spent nearly 6 months in Speyside malt whisky casks. The fruity Speysider left no smokiness behind, just spices, red fruits, and buttery barley malt. Extra rye makes for a spicier blend with a longish, dark fruit finish.",90.0,88,45.0,4.0
1680,Jonny McCormick,"Lemon and lime zest, stewed fruits drizzled in caramel, granola, butterscotch, and refined oak tones on the nose. The meatiness in Cragganmore’s new make spirit has long since mellowed in the cask. Light orange, vanilla, honey, and those nuggets of hard sherbet that spark up on the tongue. The second phase opens up toffee notes, wood spice, flapjacks, and ends with nougat and orange peel. (Batch 2; 130 bottles)",220.0,88,50.2,1.0
1688,John Hansell,"The first in a series of limited edition releases for 2015. Not as rich, thick, sweet, or deep as last year’s classic 25th Anniversary bottling. This one’s lighter, drier, and with more spice. Cinnamon, mint, nutmeg, licorice root, citrus, and subtle botanical notes, all wrapped up in caramel and vanilla. Dry, pleasant finish. If the 25th Anniversary bottling was an ideal digestif, this one is more suitable as an aperitif.",55.0,88,64.35,2.0
1689,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"There is a freshness to the wood on the nose, laced with caramel and delicate minty notes. The palate pours pleasantly chewy with molten butterscotch and offers a pleasant jolt of cinnamon and clove that suggests rye at work, before settling on bitter orange peel, salted caramel, and cocoa, leading to a drying leathery and warm spice finish. Nicely done.",50.0,88,46.5,3.0
1690,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Amping up the original Blue has pushed this blend of own-distilled flavoring and sourced base whiskies deep into sipping territory. Crème brûlée and a soft vanilla nose become Werther’s caramels, until Still Waters’ signature rye spices and white pepper take charge. Add water and it blooms like a flower, dampening the spices and leaving a round, creamy, chocolate-like mouthfeel.",33.0,88,40.0,4.0
1691,Lew Bryson,"Rich aroma of vanilla and corn, crimped and spiced with oak. Authoritative strength, full and solid; sharp oak and dry mint, with vanilla and cornbread arriving toward the finish, which is the only jarring note. There's too much woody bite at the close. Still, very much a sipping whiskey; don't put anything but a bit of water or a single cube of ice in this. By far, the best of the Total Wine store brands I've received. Sourced whiskey.",32.0,88,45.0,2.0
1692,Lew Bryson,"3 year old peated malt whisky, aged in Oregon oak. Rich nose of peat—burning leaves, a touch of sweet diesel—and fresh oak. There's no stinting on the peat; it's young, it's in your face. Whiskey to stand toe-to-toe with Portland's hopped-to-blazes beers. Not just peat: creamy malt makes a solid floor and an exit that may be the most complex part of the experience. Refined for a 3 year old. Limited annual release.",55.0,88,42.5,3.0
1696,Fred Minnick,"It begins with corn pudding, savory and sweet, developing into cornbread, cookie dough, and tapioca pudding. This is followed by cinnamon bread, raw walnut, and malt. Around mid-palate, a dominating spice kicks in. This spice remains toward the finish, where the cinnamon just pleasantly sits there. Fun sipper.",100.0,88,45.0,
1697,Gavin Smith,"This example of Rosebank was distilled in March 1992, a year before the distillery’s closure, and bottled in December 2013. The cask yielded 141 bottles. The nose is light and mildly floral, with ripe pears, honey, and vanilla. Firm and fruity on the surprisingly full palate, with a sprinkling of white pepper, plus summer berries and caramel. Tropical fruit, soft spices, and benign oak in the finish, with a final flourish of licorice. £400",676.0,88,53.8,1.0
1698,Dave Broom,"Pale gold. Lightly floral and perfumed. The impression of honey on warm buttered scones. As it opens, so this gentle complexity grows, and gives a sense of some substance. Water reveals a hint of malt, fruit syrups, and pear blossom. The palate is creamy and needs a drop of water to reveal the acid/sweet flavor of white currant, and a hint of marzipan. A classic example of a light whisky—and a distillery—which could easily be overlooked. Don’t. £74",113.0,88,51.5,1.0
1700,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A 15 year old port cask-matured Ben Nevis that is as genre-defying as it gets. Deep port notes combine with strong iodine, honey, and malt in an inviting nose. This whisky simply roars on the palate, with big jammy fruit combined with salt, iodine, and a dash of smoke. Everything comes together in the mid-palate, with an alluring core of ginger, honey, and malt. A long, flavorful finish wraps up a whisky with unique character and unmistakable appeal. (U.S. only)",140.0,88,51.1,1.0
1701,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in September 2007 and matured in a first-fill bourbon barrel (#5315), this is a fine example of how good a relatively youthful Speyside malt can be, given the right cask. Soft and fragrant on the nose, with lemongrass, ginger snaps, and light toffee notes. The palate is sweet, with ripe strawberries and spicy fudge. A spicy finish offers cinnamon, milk chocolate, and lingering citrus fruits. (220 bottles)",85.0,88,55.7,1.0
1702,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in October 1995, this single cask was aged in a refill hogshead (#10206). Primrose, ginger, cedar spice, and malt on the nose, with a hint of salt and background heather; complex. Slightly oily on the palate, with orchard fruits, milk chocolate, a suggestion of brine, and developing cloves. Dries quite rapidly in the finish, with more cloves and light oak tannins. (190 bottles)",265.0,88,52.5,
1703,Gavin Smith,"The nose opens with brine, fresh pine, sage, and sweet antiseptic. Peat, ginger, black pepper, lime, and lemon notes develop in time. Citrus fruits, caramel, and a peat-fueled barbecue on the palate, with background dark berries. The finish is medium in length, warming, and spicy, with plain chocolate and drying, crumbly peat.

(224 bottles)",105.0,88,53.4,1.0
1710,Geoffrey Kleinman,"This bourbon is a blend of whiskeys aged a minimum of 5 years, with part of that time spent in California's Central Coastal hills. Breaker leads with a strong oak nose supported by cinnamon and caramel. On the palate, the maritime impact is there: it’s softer and less oaky, with a good balance of cinnamon, caramel, and a touch of clove. Breaker is a very restrained and understated bourbon, but that’s also what makes it so damn likable. Sourced whiskey.",50.0,88,45.0,3.0
1711,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Nuts, plum, dried red fruits, plump berries, and oak on the nose, while the palate pours lush and fruity, with a sherry-like quality with pot still richness. Cigar wrapper, wet walnuts, and pine emerge to ride the wave of vanilla, soft malt, and spice-laced baked fruits. Offers the fruity allure of a Speyside malt coupled with American bravado for a long resinous and fruity finish.",59.0,88,46.7,3.0
1714,Dave Broom,"A wild aromatic opening — anise, sweet cicely, even a hint of wormwood — with more oak than the 21 year old, but not in a dominating fashion, rather just a framing device. Still fresh and acidic, with touches of a bridal bouquet, freshly baked warm sponge cake, walnut flesh, and, with water, a little bread-and-butter pudding. The acidity gives it a zippy, clean palate zestiness with cumin and angelica. Beautifully balanced. £400",636.0,88,46.0,
1716,Gavin Smith,"This expression was distilled during Arran’s second year of operation in September 1996 and bottled at 19 years of age. The single refill hogshead yielded 288 bottles. Sweet and malty on the slick nose, with honey, lively spices, and hints of pine. Ultimately, caramel and satsuma. Full on the palate, with juicy fruit, more malt and honey, and developing milk chocolate. Long and soft in the finish; lightly spiced, finally slightly citric, with a hint of brine and dry oak. £80",115.0,88,50.0,1.0
1719,Lew Bryson,"Good nose: fresh-ground corn, warm oak, and light cinnamon. Impressively friendly even at full proof: corn pudding, sun-warmed oak plank, rich and nuanced cinnamon spice, a powerful engine running strong. A splash of water brings out some sweet berries, revs up the oak and pulls out more spice, and opens up the finish into a full-throated roar of oak, corn, and sweet citrus. This is what happens when you let a good barrel run at full throttle. Sourced whiskey. (Kentucky only)",170.0,88,59.2,2.0
1727,Lew Bryson,"Diageo has “brought I.W. Harper home” after years of absence from the U.S. market with this bottling and a base bottling (see below). The source is “new” Bernheim, but with a different mashbill from the base; this is 86% corn. Nose is warm corn and oak, with some spicy clove and cinnamon notes. Great medium-weight body and balance, palate repeats the nose, oaky-sweet finish; well-integrated whiskey. But my eyes pop at the price.",75.0,88,43.0,2.0
1730,Lew Bryson,"Plenty of color, and the nose says it ain’t lying. Sharp warehouse oak aroma puts an edge on an authoritative nose of honey, Indian pudding, spicy hard candy, and old-fashioned root beer, the not-too-sugary kind. Fiery and bold on the tongue as oak roars from start to finish, but the sweetness builds sip-by-sip: cornbread, buckwheat honey, King syrup, and a teasy bit of citrus peel. Long finish as the oak dies down. At this price, let’s keep it our secret. Sourced whiskey.",30.0,88,50.5,2.0
1731,Lew Bryson,"“Tennessee bourbon” at 8 years, 3 months, and barrel proof. This and Batch 006 are the same whiskey, the same age, from different warehouse floors. Smooth sweet nose of oak and hot corn. Quite spicy on the tongue, hard-dancing oak vaults high in the mouth over a strong, sweet body. Solid oaky finish. Honest and foursquare as a Tennessee farmer; no surprises, but no disappointments either. Sourced whiskey.",90.0,88,62.35,
1732,Fred Minnick,"There’s a lot going on here: rich caramel, soft vanilla, gingerbread cookies straight from the oven, cinnamon, marzipan, honey, and peach. Then it’s a dance of the caramel/vanilla-combo richness with brown sugar, butter, and toffee. The thing is, you need to appreciate barrel strength whiskey to capture its essence, as the beasty alcohol overpowers. Even barrel strength lovers will find a splash of water opens it up, giving more caramel, walnut, and whoopie pie. Long caramel finish.",85.0,88,66.4,2.0
1733,Fred Minnick,"A combination of 7 year old year rye finished in port barrels and 11 year old wheated and rye bourbons. It presents exceptionally fruity aromas, with prominent plum and floral hints, fresh-cut grass, toasted pecan, burnt butter, brown sugar, and a touch of chocolate.

1734,Lew Bryson,"This Dry Fly Distilling project is made from grains grown in Washington by farmer Tim O'Danaher [note that different spellings are correct]. Off to a good start: a luxuriously sweet cereal aroma puffs out of the glass as I pour, and adds softened dried fruits and hard candy when actively nosed. The new American oak (53-gallon barrel) is evident immediately, tempering the sweetness with spice, walnuts, and a hard woodiness. Finish is long, balanced, enticing. Definitely enjoyable as a sipper; an interesting new direction.",65.0,88,45.0,3.0
1735,Lew Bryson,"New York Distilling's 3 year old rye is made with a 72/16/12% mashbill (rye/corn/malt) and aged in 53-gallon barrels. The rye is organic and non-GMO. Nose is clean, rich with grassy, bitter rye aroma and a nice dash of mint. Mouth is smooth but assertive: bitter-minty, a bit oily, and the wood arrives near the end. Quite nicely balanced, delivers what a rye should, and would make an excellent cocktail as well.",44.0,88,45.2,3.0
1737,John Hansell,"Malt whisky from the Scottish Highlands finished in Virginia, in Virginia wine casks. A potpourri of red fruit (raspberry, currant, cherry), tangerine, caramel, honey, and marzipan. Polished leather, tobacco, and oak on the finish.

1738,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Delicate, floral, sweet, and reminiscent of a Lowland malt with its Creamsicle nose. Flavors of papaya, bright citrus, and green tea are nicely balanced with the perfect touch of smoke on the pleasingly oily palate, while the long finish smacks of baked apples, cocoa, and minerality. Wonderfully balanced and moreish, this is a happy marriage of Virginia single malt whiskey finished in a cask that previously held Wee Heavy style beer and Scotch whisky.

1740,Davin de Kergommeaux,"In 2009, brewers Bob Baxter and Alan Hansen added a stillhouse to their Whitehorse-based Yukon Brewing Company. This 7 year old, their seventh whisky, was distilled from Scottish peated malt, creating a smoky, malty, scotch-like nose.

Then fruit, and lots of it: blackberries, blueberries, baked apples, and canned peaches, followed by wood, nutmeg, and maple syrup.

1744,Dave Broom,"Every month seems to bring a new Octomore. Much is made of the peatiness of the malt used, but just as important is the way in which it is distilled and matured. It is these two aspects that give it sweetness and balance. This is minty, honey-sweet, with meadowsweet, some dried lavender, tinned peaches, and that hot sand note typical of Bruichladdich. The smoke is merely suggestive, giving an integrated power. 5 years old? Who knows what might happen next?",180.0,88,63.0,1.0

release is very Cardhu, with masses of mandarin, dried peach, and honey, reminiscent of a fine oxidized Chinese Phoenix Oolong tea, while still retaining the effervescent buzz of youth.

Very pale in color, showing the limited oak influence. The used cask allows the rye to shine. An uncluttered whiskey, with fresh mint, soft cinnamon, creamy vanilla, hay, cut grass, and honeyed orchard fruit (green apple, pear, peach). Grassy finish. The more elegant of the two.",100.0,87,46.2,

Well-balanced and soothing. A very easy-drinking whiskey. (Reviewer’s note: these are single barrel bottlings, and they will vary from one barrel to the next.)",90.0,87,55.4,
1791,John Hansell,"A combination of 10 and 19 year old bourbons from two different recipes. Very spicy, but no excessive oak (given the 19 year old component). Still, there’s definitely more oak than last year’s release, and maybe more than I would like for balance. Along with the cinnamon, cool mint, cocoa powder, and nutmeg, there are caramelized sugars and bright citrus notes. This is a tight whiskey -- not heavy and lethargic, like some 10-plus year old bourbons can be. The flavors are crisp and vibrant, all the way to its polished oak, tobacco-tinged finish.",80.0,87,,2.0
1792,John Hansell,"I was concerned this whiskey would be woody and dry, but it isn’t. (By comparison, the 2009 “Mariage Collection” release, a combination of 10 and 19 year old whiskeys, comes across much more tannic and dry—especially on the finish.) The grain influence is less prominent (as might be expected), but it is replaced by some nicely dovetailed oak sugars and spices, and forward fruit. It’s gentle on the nose and palate, with creamy vanilla, caramel custard, apricot, nectarine, glazed citrus, cherry pie, and graham cracker, spiked with subtle mint, clove, and cinnamon. Smooth, soothing finish…therapeutic even. If you like your bourbons bold, stimulating, and challenging, then this one isn’t for you. But if you want bourbon to comfort you like a warm blanket in cold weather, then give this a try.",75.0,87,55.0,2.0
1793,Fred Minnick,"Lovely cinnamon candies offer an entrancing first taste, with lemon drop and orange sherbet close behind. Baking spices come on strong mid-palate, with undertones of caramel and vanilla. But what makes this special is its mouthfeel: tingly and warming the palate throughout. Cinnamon is ever-present.",20.0,87,40.0,2.0
1794,John Hansell,"A follow up to the original Jefferson’s Ocean, 62 barrels of mature bourbon spent 5 months at sea. Can I detect any noticeable sea influence? Not really—perhaps a hint of brine—but it’s nice, pleasant bourbon nonetheless with nothing out of place. Well rounded notes of layered sweetness (caramel, vanilla, maple syrup and a hit of sweet corn), honeyed orchard fruit, and spiced with cinnamon and evergreen. Soft, soothing finish. Sourced whiskey.",70.0,87,41.15,2.0
1796,Lew Bryson,"After regular bourbon maturation, this is finished in a barrel made from toasted wood with no charring (and no age statement). The wood character of the nose is restrained; corn, vanilla, some nuts and light citrus, but just a light hint of oak spice. Complex mouth: corn pudding, cornmeal, sugar cookies, caramel, pawpaw, jackfruit, and a real creaminess that stretches into the finish…where we get the delayed oak. Mature whiskey smooth, young whiskey lively, and a good price, too. Sourced whiskey.",48.0,87,45.7,2.0
1797,John Hansell,"The third straight year of Birthday Bourbon releases. Last year we were blessed with not one, but two practically flawless whiskeys (one quite richly flavored, the other light and delicate). This 1995 vintage is nearly as good and reminds me in some ways of the first Birthday Bourbon release two years ago. Sweet notes of caramel, maple, cocoa powder, and vanilla fudge (particularly on the front of the palate) are mingled with candied fruit and dry mint. The whiskey finishes fairly dry (more than its bouquet would suggest) with notes of polished leather, mint, dark chocolate, and dried tea.",45.0,87,47.0,2.0
1798,John Hansell,"Ripe fruit (peach, apricot, golden raisin) on the front of the palate, followed by layered sweet notes of caramel, butterscotch, and toffee, finishing with oak, dried vanilla, and a hint of cinnamon. Great mouthfeel. Each barrel is unique in flavor profile. There’s no barrel number identified on the label, so the one you buy may vary slightly. Having said this, the barrel I reviewed was very enjoyable.",40.0,87,49.3,2.0
1799,Gavin Smith,"Matured in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. It offers a nose redolent of Christmas pudding: figs, sultanas, orange, honey, and cream. Smooth on the palate with sweet spicy sherry, orchard fruits, and caramel. Raisins and plain chocolate in the lingering finish, with Jaffa orange notes to the end.",55.0,87,40.0,1.0
1800,John Hansell,"A prime component in Dewar’s blended scotch. The finer bottles of Aberfeldy are quite flavorful, yet still maintain a degree of elegance and finesse. This bottling is an excellent example of this. Its dominant flavor note is fruit (orange, honeydew melon), with some creamy vanilla notes, caramel, and light toffee. Subtle spice notes and a hint of peat tease the palate. The extra aging adds depth to the whisky, yet this whisky remains quite clean and fresh on the palate. Subtly spicy, gently dry finish. Nicely done! (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot, Chicago, IL.)",110.0,87,,1.0
1801,Gavin Smith,"Independent releases of the Perthshire single malt Aberfeldy are relatively rare, and the first batch of That Boutique-y Whisky Company’s no age statement Aberfeldy runs to 155 numbered bottles. The nose features coconut ice, vanilla, malt, candied peel, and ginger. Good mouthfeel, with more malt, ginger-nut biscuits, icing sugar, and milk chocolate. The finish is drying, with oak and black pepper. £65/500 ml",105.0,87,47.0,1.0
1802,Dave Broom,"Maybe not as massive as its higher-strength brother (see above), but don’t think that this is light. There’s immediate grumbling peatiness, mixed with dark chocolate, lanolin, and tamarind, while the spiciness brings to mind tandoori food. There’s still the seaweed element, while the lower strength pulls things into a darker core—coal tar soap, damp moss. A very oily palate, that with water takes you onto the peat bog. Seashells on a fire and more smoke round things off.",110.0,87,46.5,1.0
1803,John Hansell,"A single cask of Ardmore aged in a first-fill bourbon cask and then finished in quarter casks. This one is more mature, with more depth than the standard Ardmore Traditional Cask (which I rated 80 a few years back). Notes of toffee, vanilla bean, chocolate fudge, licorice stick, bourbon, tar, charcoal, and a hint of burnt raisin. Very nice! (A Julio’s Liquors Exclusive.)",50.0,87,,1.0
1804,John Hansell,"Complex, dynamic, and well-balanced. Honeyed vanilla, bright fruit (lemon, tangerine, nectarine), sultana, green grapes, and banana bread, peppered with ginger and subtle, gripping grape skin. Great mouth-feel (from the oak), which adds another dimension. That’s what 46% and no chill-filtering will do for a whisky. One of the better Arran whiskies I’ve tasted. (Released in 2009. Sadly not available in the U.S.)£38",62.0,87,46.0,1.0
1805,Gavin Smith,"The latest limited release in the Icons of Arran series was distilled in 1999 and matured in fourteen ex-bourbon barrels and seven sherry hogsheads. Initially launched in the UK, but global availability is anticipated. A sprinkling of coconut, vanilla, and spices, with pears, melons, and pineapple on the nose. Full and fruity on the palate, becoming maltier and nuttier. Sweet spices, especially stem ginger, and a hint of honey. Drying slowly in the very spicy finish (6,000 bottles). £42",66.0,87,46.0,1.0
1806,Gavin Smith,"This U.S.-exclusive Premium Bourbon Single cask #2096 contrasts nicely with its sherry cask-matured sibling, and offers vanilla, cocoa powder, malt extract, ripe bananas, and spicy sultanas on the nose. The palate is smooth and spicy, with ginger snaps and developing butteriness. The finish is medium to long, with chili notes and citrus fruits at the last.",130.0,87,52.0,1.0
1807,Gavin Smith,"The ancient variety of barley known as bere that was used to make this Arran single malt was grown on Orkney and distilled in 2004. It was matured for eight years in bourbon barrels, and 5,800 bottles have been released. Very fruity on the nose, principally peaches, with vanilla and fudge, something slightly herbal, wet grass, and finally homemade lemonade. Oily mouthfeel, with fresh oak, cloves, and wild berries. An atypical Arran! The finish is drying and moreish.  £48",75.0,87,46.0,1.0
1808,Gavin Smith,"A limited edition of 12,000 bottles, this expression from Arran was initially matured in first-fill bourbon barrels before a secondary period of aging in American oak quarter casks, which accelerated maturation. A big hit of tinned peaches, then malt, cinnamon, vanilla, and caramel. Sweet and rounded on the palate, with lots of fresh fruit, notably pineapple, plus caramel, chili, and ginger. Relatively long in the fruity finish, with brittle toffee, new oak, and persistent spice. £55",80.0,87,55.7,1.0
1809,Gavin Smith,"This 1977 ‘house’ vintage expression has been matured for 32 years in oloroso sherry casks. Just 240 bottles have been produced. Delicate, sweet, and floral on the nose, with old leather, caramel, vanilla, and malt. The caramel deepens with time. The palate is initially sweet, smooth, and malty, with pear drops; becoming nuttier, with soft oak in the medium-length finish. £370 Currently not available in the U.S.",607.0,87,49.0,1.0
1810,Gavin Smith,"The latest triple distilled bottling from the Lowland distillery of Auchentoshan has been matured for 35 years in bourbon casks and is presented non-chill filtered and at cask strength. Just 500 bottles are available globally. Apple crumble and custard on the nose, with developing cereal notes. Smooth and enticing. Spice, fresh fruits, honey, and marzipan on the buttery palate, which ultimately becomes drier. The finish is long and discreetly drying, with spices, malted barley, and a citrus tang in the tail. Price is approximate.",750.0,87,46.9,1.0
1811,Gavin Smith,"This is the second batch of Silveroak 1990 from Auchentoshan, and it has benefited from an extra year of maturation in bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. The 22 year old is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets. Notably floral on the nose, with fudge, banana, ginger, and attractive oak. On the palate it delivers vanilla, apricots, apples, more ginger, and oak. The finish is long and spicy, with dark coffee notes and a hint of menthol. Greater complexity than its predecessor.",145.0,87,50.9,1.0
1812,Gavin Smith,"Balblair has followed up the first release of its 1975 vintage bottling with a second, which differs significantly in character, having been matured in American oak sherry casks, whereas the initial release had been aged in Spanish oak sherry casks. Floral, mellow, and slightly oily on the nose, with a savory background and ready-salted crisps. Silky smooth on the palate, with citrus fruit, a hint of wood smoke, coconut, and honey. The finish is spicy, with aniseed and oak.",375.0,87,46.0,1.0
1813,Gavin Smith,"Balblair Vintage 2003 replaces the previous 2002 expression, matured in second-fill bourbon barrels, with the contents of eighteen making up this first release. Tinned peaches and apricot jam on the nose, with underlying honey and caramel. Early malt, then zesty lemon notes on the palate, which also features freshly-cut grass and hazelnuts. The medium-length finish yields white pepper and cocoa powder.",65.0,87,46.0,1.0
1814,Gavin Smith,"Launched in December 2015, the first release of Balblair’s Vintage 2005 replaces the previous 2003 expression. This is the youngest bottling in the brand’s portfolio. It was matured in bourbon barrels and is non-chill filtered. The nose is relatively light and fruity: vanilla, ripe bananas, honey, a wisp of smoke, and soft spices.  Toffee, malt, vanilla, a biscuit-like note, more bananas, and new leather on the palate, closing with a lengthy, spicy finish.",60.0,87,46.0,1.0
1815,Dave Broom,"After the 68’s quiet nature, we reach Balvenie in fully mature, robust character—well, as robust as Balvenie ever gets. That means more cask-derived notes of vanilla ice, butterscotch, crème brûlée, and a jag of citrus bringing you to your senses. There’s squidgy caramel toffee and the honey is now fixed in the comb adding that distinct waxiness of old, gently matured whisky. The biggest and sweetest of the series. Excellent.",,87,50.2,
1816,Gavin Smith,"This was aged in a refill American oak hogshead, as was the 1981 expression. Like that variant, it has pineapple and lemon on the nose and also yields milk chocolate, green apples, and fresh-sawn wood. Smooth, full, and sweet on the palate, again with very ripe tropical fruits, plus apple pie. The finish is medium in length; quite austere.",,87,51.9,1.0
1817,John Hansell,"Very traditional West Highland style: somewhat rustic, muscular, and oily in texture, with notes of leather, bourbon, espresso, orange peel, kiwi, and a suggestion of ultra-aged Caribbean rum. Occasionally, a softer side of vanilla and coconut shows itself, but, if this whiskey were a man, he would be a lumberjack.",300.0,87,58.4,1.0
1818,John Hansell,"Very robust and chewy-this whisky has plenty of gusto-with notes of toffee, vanilla cream, bitter chocolate, powdered cocoa, and almond fig cake. Background citrus (especially on the nose), tobacco, and polished leather. Nice depth for such a young whisky, and very exciting.",70.0,87,,1.0
1819,Gavin Smith,"This single cask 17 year old expression of Ben Nevis was matured in a sherry butt which yielded 747 bottles. It appears in Carn Mor’s “Strictly Limited” series of releases and has not been chill filtered. The bold nose opens with slightly savory notes and hard-boiled eggs. Sherry, malt, and figs subsequently develop. Quite full-bodied, with rich Jaffa orange and developing plain chocolate on the palate. More dark chocolate and a suggestion of fennel in the medium-length finish. £55",93.0,87,46.0,1.0
1820,John Hansell,"Leafy bonfire smoke, damp kiln, tar, anise, dark chocolate, and a hint of clove. All this is balanced by an underlying malty foundation and a kiss of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit. Nice to see single cask, cask strength bottlings of peated BenRiach. (Exclusive to The Party Source.)",66.0,87,56.0,
1821,John Hansell,"It’s very exciting to see a peated Speyside whisky; they are so rare these days. Ideally, the peat smoke will add an additional dimension to the whisky without dominating the whisky’s other flavors. Most Speysiders are big enough to embrace the smoke, as is the case with this expression of BenRiach. The turfy peat smoke is offset nicely by layers of sweetness (oatcakes, butterscotch, vanilla, and honeyed malt) and soft fruit. Dry, smoking ember finish. A steep price for a 10 year old whisky-whisky prices have been climbing faster than real estate lately-but this whisky is worth its price.",65.0,87,46.0,1.0
1822,John Hansell,"The most richly textured and complex of the unpeated expressions. Base notes of honeyed malt and creamy vanilla are complemented by citrus fruit (lemon, tangerine), coconut, bitter chocolate, exotic wood shavings, and a hint of assorted nuts. Polished oak finish.",140.0,87,46.0,1.0
1823,Gavin Smith,"This bottling replaces the 15 year old Tawny Port Wood Finish. After first maturating in bourbon barrels, finishing took place in tawny port casks. The nose offers vanilla and milky coffee, with peppery red berries and a hint of plain chocolate. Vanilla, toffee, orange, and spicy oak on the palate, while the finish is long and warming, with more spicy oak. £110",137.0,87,46.0,1.0
1824,Gavin Smith,"Introduced in 2004, Curiositas was the first peated expression to be marketed by BenRiach. It has been peated to 55ppm and matured in bourbon casks. Mildly medicinal earthy peat on the nose, hot road tar, honey, and light tropical fruit aromas. Iodine and smoky peat on the palate, with mineral notes, dried fruits, allspice, and oak. More oak in the medium-length finish, with peanut and peppery peat.",60.0,87,46.0,1.0
1825,Dave Broom,"The aim with Benromach was always to rediscover an older Speyside style, and this shows how well owner Gordon & MacPhail has succeeded. There’s a profound sherried introduction, just a little malt, then it is all fruitcakes and light smoke. The palate is properly old-style and oily, with some pleasing zingy orange peel toward the back of the palate. Chewy and medium-bodied with good layering.",100.0,87,43.0,1.0
1826,Gavin Smith,"This vintage Benromach has been finished in Sassicaia wine casks from the Bolgheri wine region of Italy after maturation in first-fill bourbon barrels. Red currants and warm peat, ginger, and vanilla on the nose. Initially, juicy fruit on the palate, but soon drier than expected from the nose. Dark berry fruits and subtle smoke develop. Relatively long in the finish, with gentle spices. Ultimately, sweeter soft fruit notes return. (8,000 bottles)",48.0,87,45.0,1.0
1827,Jonny McCormick,"The latest version of the first certified organic Scotch whisky is a creamy malt that has lashings of vanilla, banana peel, and pecan pie aromas. Smooth, malty flavors abound. Banoffee pie topped with sliced banana, apple, nectarine, and ripe peach, with a good flare of peppery spices. Fuzzy, earthy spice, then an outro of sweet fudge. With water, more green fruit, melon, tropical fruits, and a little chili kick emerge.",70.0,87,43.0,1.0
1828,John Hansell,"Bright gold color, and bright in flavor. Very much in the Bladnoch style, with honey-kissed lemon, tangerine, kiwi, creamy vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, marzipan, cut grass, and hay. Richly textured for a Lowland, and palate-coating (a tad oily, too!). The extra years have added some depth, while still retaining a youthful zest. Very enjoyable.",120.0,87,,1.0
1829,Gavin Smith,"Samsara’s (reviewed winter 2016) younger sibling Adela presents an altogether different profile, having been matured in oloroso casks. Like Samsara, it has not been chill filtered. The nose is nutty, with quite dry sherry notes and prickly spice. Finally, fragrant toffee emerges. Very supple in the mouth, where the sherry becomes sweeter, along with black currants, licorice, and then black pepper. The finish is medium in length, dry, and peppery.",138.0,87,46.7,1.0
1830,John Hansell,"Matured in a port pipe. The third in a trilogy (the other two being bourbon and sherry cask-aged). I like this one better than the sherry cask 1990 vintage, but not quite as much as the bourbon cask bottling which was in our Top Ten whiskies two years ago. Lovely amber ruby color. The port flavors are obvious, but not sappy or dominating. They’re clean, and contribute a layered sweetness and ripe red berry fruit notes to the traditional, moderately peated Bowmore smoke and peat. Lingering smoke and chocolate on the finish.",100.0,87,53.1,1.0
1831,John Hansell,"Medium-bodied and nicely textured. Good balance of flavors -- and well-integrated, too -- with lovely sweet notes (cereal grain, cookie dough, caramel, and vanilla cream), young heathery peat, tar, fishnets, and brine that is complementary, but not aggressive, with a suggestion of lavender and tangerine. Balanced finish. (332 bottles produced.)",60.0,87,46.0,1.0
1832,Dave Broom,"Last year’s was a top-notch, defiantly sherried example of Bowmore. This year’s batch thrusts equally boldly, but starts in a more Japanese-accented fashion: think soy, miso paste, and salmon teriyaki. Light leather, with hickory campfire smoke coming through strongly. The big, oily, tarry palate is like a spent barbecue with a hint of skidding car tires on Bowmore High Street. So, still a belter, but why so limited? Beam Suntory, please sort it out! (6,000 bottles) £60",95.0,87,56.3,1.0
1833,Dave Broom,"It’s only right that the first single malt scotch given a period of time (3 years in this case) in Japanese oak (mizunara) casks is from Beam Suntory-owned Bowmore. It’s a fascinating mix of the vanilla, spice, and incense notes of mizunara and Bowmore’s distillery characteristics. You get rich peat, black pepper, apricot, and peach all playing alongside each other. The palate is clean and lighter than the nose suggests, with a fresh zestiness before the smoke leans back in.",1000.0,87,53.9,1.0
1834,John Hansell,"Aged in a sherry cask, and the sherry is clean and bright. I’m also picking up a good dose of warming peat smoke, along with molasses, and a gentle maltiness throughout. A peppering of subtle brine and a hint of seaweed peak through occasionally, reminding one of its Islay roots.",80.0,87,55.5,
1835,John Hansell,"Bright gold color. Fresh, appetizing aroma of vanilla malt, honey, brine, and subtle tropical fruit. Light to medium in body and slightly oily in texture. Delicious, fresh, subtly complex flavors of vanilla malt, sea salt, subtle tropical fruit, and fresh herbs, finishing dry and lightly spicy.
   Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $70s. Available nationwide. 
   Since the owners of Murray McDavid also control the Bruichladdich distillery, one would expect a good bottling. This is a good one indeed, and very exciting to drink. It is nicely matured, fresh, and deliciously appetizing-almost mouth-watering.",80.0,87,46.0,1.0
1836,John Hansell,"This is six year old, 40 ppm phenol (very smoky) whisky distilled at Bruichladdich, bottled at cask strength and enhanced in Madeira casks. A young whisky, but mature enough to say that it’s not too young. The immediate impact is damp peat smoke and smoldering charcoal. If you are patient and observant enough (and with an addition of water), you’ll coax notes of vanilla, berried fruit, pear, green apple, and underlying spice (fresh mint, anise), all leading to a briny, smoldering smoke finish. A cult whisky for those who like to push the envelope. When compared to its predecessor, PC5, PC6 is slightly darker in color, creamier, fruitier, and a shade softer. Given this, I still prefer the PC5 over the PC6 for its clarity and innocence.",140.0,87,61.6,
1837,John Hansell,"The fresher of the two, with appetizing brine, honey, lemon rock candy, golden raisin, and peach. Subtle ginger, toasted marshmallow, and coconut round out the palate. Very bright and lively.",100.0,87,46.0,1.0
1838,John Hansell,"Vanilla fudge, barley grist, fresh sea spray, berries, and nuts all integrated nicely. A gentle, comforting dram that accommodates many moods and situations.",48.0,87,43.0,1.0
1839,Dave Broom,"Full gold in color, this Bunna initially has the lifted Moscatel aroma that’s reminiscent of a fine Darjeeling leaf tea, then comes melting milk chocolate and touches of sweet cinnamon toast. The palate continues in this sweet vein, but has the distillery’s characteristic thickness in the mid-palate, as well as plenty of its signature fresh ginger note. With water, there are some baked fruits and a hint of flowers. Altogether delicious and subtly complex.",135.0,87,55.7,1.0
1840,Dave Broom,"Here’s an Islay distillery which has never quite had the investment it deserves. Hopefully this limited release is the start of an addressing of that situation. It has a classic nose with ginger (crystallized) to the fore alongside toasted almond and the balsamic note that you sometimes get with extra-mature whiskies, manifested here as mulberry vinegar. The mouth has coconut, some grip, and — though it fades a little speedily — retained fire. Take with water on the side.  £1,999",3104.0,87,41.7,1.0
1841,John Hansell,"The Islay character is most evident in the younger whisky expressions, before the oak has tamed them. This whisky is a perfect example: an uninhibited, incredibly powerful Caol Ila, thumping out notes of tarry rope, damp peat, kippers, and seaweed. Background spices (salt, pepper, ginger) add intrigue, while a firm foundation of vanilla malt struggles to provide soothing comfort. Extreme Islay whisky. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.)",55.0,87,58.1,1.0
1842,John Hansell,"Bright fruit throughout (red raspberry, strawberry-rhubarb pie, gooseberry, red currant, nectarine), honeyed malt, dark chocolate, tarry rope, seaweed soaked in olive brine, and ground pepper. Tarry finish. Nicely balanced, well-defined flavors, and fully mature at 10 years of age.",70.0,87,46.0,
1843,Dave Broom,"With no great wood on show, this is a Caol Ila which is time—not oak—driven. A very scented, nay herbal start, like bouquet garni with light smoke, grapefruit, sea-washed stones, ozone, and heather blossom. The retention of aromatics is gorgeous. Water increases the peat effect but diminishes the aromatics, so take your choice. Well worth a look.",156.0,87,52.2,1.0
1844,Dave Broom,"Restrained, ozonic, with no great smokiness to open, but there is a touch of green grass behind meadow flowers and salt-washed stones so typical of the distillery. With water another marker—drying fishing nets—comes through, with breaths of the sea. Subtle and refined. More smoke on the palate, where it’s like a flowering currant bush on fire. Great balance of different elements: smoke, fragrance, oil, acidity. With water, real saltiness comes through. Very good. £99",167.0,87,55.5,1.0
1845,Dave Broom,"The now-annual unpeated release shows its high strength on the nose, but under the burn is a clean, mineral, and slightly lean Caol Ila with just a tiny whiff of smoke. A mix of grassiness/herbal notes, with delicate white fruits that plump out into tinned fruit salad, gooseberry, and fresh pineapple. The palate is sweet and cake-like, while the heat enhances its salty tang. Delightful, sweet, and long. (10,668 bottles)",120.0,87,60.39,1.0
1846,John Hansell,"It’s good to see an official distillery bottling of Clynelish in the U.S. This one is very true to the Clynelish style: fresh, appetizing, and very drinkable. Notes of brine, fruit (lemon-lime), and vanilla-accented malt, are the foundation of this whisky. Delicate seaweed, peat, exotic pepper and a hint of citrus rind bitterness entertain the palate throughout, all the way to its appetizingly briny, seaweed-tinged finish. Perhaps the definitive aperitif whisky.",45.0,87,46.0,1.0
1847,Gavin Smith,"Refill sherry hogsheads have been used to mature the latest Gordon & MacPhail bottling of Clynelish, the most northerly distillery in Diageo’s portfolio. Initially quite earthy on the nose, with mustard seeds, pepper, and contrasting malt. Becoming progressively sweeter and less complex. Quite oily in texture, the earthiness carries over from the nose onto the palate, then sweet fruit notes, malt, and spice emerge, plus a delicate thread of smoke. The finish dries slowly, with a hint of peat.",70.0,87,43.0,1.0
1848,Gavin Smith,"This 15 year old bottling of Diageo’s Sutherland single malt comes courtesy of The Creative Whisky Co., whose Exclusive Malts range of single cask, cask strength Scotch malt whiskies has recently been imported into the U.S. Fleeting burnt sugar on the nose, then mango and brittle toffee. Vanilla emerges, with slightly smoky malt. Finally, cloves. Mouth-coating, with lively spices, fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate. Relatively long in the finish, with ginger snaps and a wax-like texture.",100.0,87,53.5,1.0
1849,Gavin Smith,"The latest Wemyss single cask release of Clynelish from the distillery at Brora in Sutherland runs to 258 bottles and has been matured in a hogshead. Freshly-sliced green apples on the nose, slightly peppery, with grated nutmeg and salted caramels. Relatively full-bodied, with lots of soft fruit, principally Jaffa oranges, and sweet spice. Spicy caramel and cocoa powder in the slowly drying, medium-length finish. £75",68.0,87,46.0,1.0
1850,John Hansell,"Matured in port casks. The standard Cragganmore 12 year old is one of Scotland’s best kept secrets-I enjoy its incredibly complex, dry, spicy character. The port contributes ripe fruit flavors (cherries in syrup, golden raisins, mandarin, glazed berries) which complements the dry spicy notes nicely and makes for a more balanced product. Still, for this, the whisky sacrifices some of its individuality and brilliancy with all that port. A fair trade-off, though.",65.0,87,40.0,
1851,Dave Broom,"This oft-overlooked Speysider has been frustratingly variable in the past, but now seems to have hit greater consistency. Worm tubs and weird stills combine to give a complex malt, but one that needs help from oak to blossom fully. There are hedgerow aromas: black currant leaf, hawthorn berries, and lots of honey. A chestnut note continues on the tongue where, on the finish, a hint of smoke lurks.",50.0,87,43.0,1.0
1852,John Hansell,"Aged in American oak for 14 years and then finished off in Spanish sherry butts for several more. A rich, lush, sherried Dalmore expression. Fruity notes of succulent orange, strawberry rhubarb tart, and sultana, on a bed of toffee and vanilla. A peppering of cinnamon, lemon rock candy, chocolate-covered coffee bean, and lavender adds complexity. Perhaps a little heavy-handed with the sherry, but still, it’s a solid effort and a Dalmore to enjoy after dinner or as a nightcap.",150.0,87,43.0,1.0
1853,Gavin Smith,"Comprising 100 percent whisky matured in oloroso sherry casks, the Tay Dram is fresh and vibrant on the nose, with fruit and toffee. Fuller bodied than the Tweed or Dee Drams, with more overt evidence of sherry, followed through by honey, almonds, coffee, and toffee. Dark chocolate is to the fore in the lengthy finish — this time closer to chocolate orange confectionery. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",69.0,87,40.0,1.0
1854,Gavin Smith,"The Dalmore has added a new expression to its Travel Retail portfolio, namely Valour. This variant carries no age statement and maturation began in first-fill bourbon casks and 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts before undergoing a finishing period in port pipes. The result is a nose of black currants, caramel, and musty sherry. The palate is medium-sweet, with damsons, Jaffa oranges, and printer’s ink. Dark berries emerge in time. The finish embraces drying spices, figs, and mildly astringent oak.",72.0,87,40.0,1.0
1855,John Hansell,"Style: Highland single malt scotch Color: Gold Aroma: Quite fruity (especially apples). Hint of honey and caramel with subtle background oak. Prickling alcohol before the addition of water. Palate: Smooth and mouth-coating. Nicely balanced. Delicately honeyed fruit notes up from, followed by oak and toffee, becoming dry and spicy with pleasant lingering oak.",300.0,87,57.8,1.0
1856,Dave Broom,"Equally honeyed; in fact here the finish (oloroso this time) seems to enhance the sweetness. Out comes Manuka honey, Greek yogurt, and heavy blossom notes while the sherry itself brings in a nutty, polished note. There’s just a hint of sulfur when you add water (Dalwhinnie is a sulfury new make). The finish is long with some Brazil nut. Try frozen with dessert.",81.0,87,43.0,1.0
1857,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1997 and bottled in 2014, this expression of Dalwhinnie spent a period finishing in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers honey, ripe oranges, peach blossom, and creamy milk chocolate, with just a wisp of smoke. Full-bodied and sweet on the palate, with orange zest, walnuts, more honey, and fruit spices. The finish is long and warming, with a hint of peat and spicy oak.",85.0,87,43.0,1.0
1858,John Hansell,"Gold color. Aromas of toffee, nuts, and a hint of mint. Medium in body, with a malty, coating texture. The flavors evolve on the palate, with toffee up front, malty sweetness in the middle and nutty, finishing pleasantly dry with a hint of mint and vanilla.",135.0,87,49.4,1.0
1859,John Hansell,"A release chosen by Douglas Maclean (and named after his song “Caledonia”). Full sherry impact, but contained—not excessive or sappy. Rich, with nutty toffee, pot still rum, a variety of raisins (regular and golden), date, honeyed fruit, polished leather, and a hint of tobacco. Good resinous grip on the finish to balance the sweetness. The flavors are nicely integrated.",80.0,87,,1.0
1860,Gavin Smith,"Edradour, in Perthshire, is owned by independent bottler Signatory, who has released a wide variety of expressions during the past few years. However, the standard 12 year old remains a classic of its kind.  Cider apples, malt, almonds, vanilla, and honey on the nose, along with a hint of smoke and sherry. The palate is creamy and malty, with a persistent nuttiness and quite pronounced sherry, plus a touch of leather. Spices and sherry dominate the medium to long finish.",50.0,87,40.0,1.0
1861,John Hansell,"Matured in a “rejuvenated European oak” cask. Balance: that’s what I like best about this whisky. It’s not as individualistic or distinctive as the others, but that’s how I always think of Glen Elgin, so no surprise here. This is a solid effort: fruity and flowery, with notes of tangerine, marmalade, caramel apple, ginger, cut grass, cinnamon, almond paste, and underlying vanilla, lingering in a satisfying finish. (534 bottles) £250",406.0,87,61.1,1.0
1862,Dave Broom,"The least well-known of the Fogwatt trio which includes Longmorn and BenRiach, it’s unlikely that Glen Elgin will become a major brand anytime soon, given how important it is to blenders. A combination of long, slow ferments, and distillation coupled with worm tubs gives a ludicrously fruity spirit, which here is bulging with ripe peach, apricot, and Galia melon coated in cinnamon and nutmeg, given thick weight by the worm tubs. A classic. £34",52.0,87,43.0,1.0
1863,John Hansell,"Amber chestnut color. Aromas are rich and express great depth, with highlights of ripe fruit and wood spices. Well-rounded flavors are balanced very nicely, with a gentle sweetness up front that marries well with ripe fruit, becoming dry with background wood spice notes.",98.0,87,58.2,1.0
1864,Dave Broom,"Old gold in color. Obviously an old whisky, but a delicate one that has subtle complexities; the balance between the dried grass/hayloft, the dried orange peel, and stewed apple, for example. Sweet and fragrant, it shows chypre notes with water alongside a more gentle floral aspect. The palate is drier than the nose suggests, quite mineral, with a lacy character. The finish shows melon and mint. Glen Grant in gentle repose.£88",138.0,87,55.0,1.0
1865,Dave Broom,"Deep ruby with a yellow rim. Clearly mature, and heavily sherried. A highly concentrated nose: Marmite and soy sauce, and all the fresh fruits of youth reduced to essence. Drinkwise, it’s closest to Chinato: curative barks, dried herbs (mint, hyssop, oregano). The palate is unsurprisingly thick and lightly smoky, but the tannins aren't overly astringent, and there remains a sweet core still, even if the overall effect is dark. It’s not obviously Glen Grant, but it is a fascinating glass.",14999.0,87,54.4,1.0
1866,John Hansell,"Bright gold color. Big and firm on the palate. Quite fruity too (tangerine, pear, sultana, pineapple), on a dry malty foundation. Lighter notes of grass, hay, linseed oil, and dried vanilla add complexity. Dried fruit and malt finish. A really nice dram with gobs of character.",110.0,87,60.3,
1867,John Hansell,"Glen Scotia has always been the bridesmaid to Springbank. This is justifiable, considering that both production and availability of quality bottlings have been sporadic over the past decade or so. I like this one. It really shows the simple, coastal pleasantness of this Campbeltown distillery. Ripe malty notes are accompanied by brine, cut hay, banana cream pie, and honeyed vanilla. Lingering salty, malty finish. With all the sherried and wine-finished Springbanks recently on the market (not that there’s anything wrong with that), here’s a nice, no-frills, Campbeltown whisky.",114.0,87,46.0,1.0
1868,Gavin Smith,"The nose gives a whiff of vanilla fudge, then black pepper, sea salt, and a savory note develops. The palate yields maritime-tinged candied fruits and effervescent smoke. Slightly tarry in the finish. Macho!",88.0,87,46.0,1.0
1869,Gavin Smith,"Whiskies in Douglas Laing’s new Old Particular range are non-chill filtered and bottled at three strengths, with those aged 19 years and over being offered at 51.5%. This Glen Scotia was distilled in May 1992 and boasts a nose of violets, musky malt, soft smoke, and a fresh sea breeze. Big, spicy, and quite oily on the palate, with dark berries, black tea, and a note of tar. Long and dark in the finish, with oak tannins and persistent licorice. £85",137.0,87,51.5,1.0
1870,Gavin Smith,"The most expensive of Glen Scotia’s new trio has been finished in deeply-charred barrels and bottled non-chill filtered at cask strength. Soft and sweet on the nose, with peaches, fudge, and a hint of oak. Full-bodied and slightly oily on the palate, with wood spices, vanilla, and blackberries. Smoky ginger and lively char in the lengthy finish.",115.0,87,51.5,1.0
1871,John Hansell,"Although this distillery is operating, it remains one of the hardest Speyside whiskies to find. This is unfortunate. A fairly straight-forward whisky-pleasingly malty and somewhat viscous on the palate, with some grassy notes. The extra years, with this particular bottling anyway, have allowed the whisky to blossom, become a little more intriguing and heavier. Along with malt and grassy notes, I’m picking up citrus fruit (especially on the nose), toffee, nuts, freshly ground roasted cocoa beans, nougat, and vanilla fudge.",210.0,87,46.0,1.0
1872,Gavin Smith,"This is a single cask (#729) bottling, distilled in 1982, and the outturn was just 260 bottles. Soft and supple on the waxy nose, with worn leather, Jaffa oranges, and malt. Lots of leather, with brittle toffee, orange creams, and a slightly musty note on the full palate. Mouth-drying in the lengthy finish, but the tannins never come close to overwhelming. £280",451.0,87,46.0,
1873,John Hansell,"Over the past decade there has been no shortage of Glendronach expressions. I know of at least one 15 year old, an 18 year old, a 19 year old, a 1968 vintage, and four different 12 year old versions. My favorite of the range was the limited edition 19 year old released here in the U.S. about a decade ago. The 1968 Vintage, which you can still find on retailers’ shelves, is also a worthy dram. But this new 12 year old “Original” expression is certainly my favorite of the 12s (and the 15). I feel that Glendronach expresses itself best when it is not dominated by the sherry, allowing a greater balance of flavors. This whisky was originally matured in sherry casks, but was then (fortunately) aged in bourbon casks for the remainder of its maturation. The result? A richly flavored, nicely balanced whisky expressing notes of sherried fruit, burnt caramel, light toffee, and nuts, all underpinned by a soothing malty foundation. Yum!",48.0,87,,1.0
1874,John Hansell,"The rich, sweet Sauternes dessert wine adds its signature. Quite lush, with golden raisin, crème brûlée, rhubarb pie, honey-kissed citrus, and creamy vanilla. A lovely example of a dessert whisky — comforting, warming, and embracing. (I would also enjoy this after a brunch of crepes, fresh fruit, and maple syrup.)",75.0,87,,1.0
1875,Gavin Smith,"This batch of GlenDronach’s popular cask strength has been aged in a combination of oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. Malt, honey, rose blossom, and chocolate-coated Turkish Delight, plus emerging vanilla on the nose. The palate is full and rounded, very sweet, with more milk chocolate and very gentle spice. The finish is lengthy, with milky coffee, sweet spices, and subtle oak.",72.0,87,55.3,1.0
1876,Dave Broom,"This is a refill (or in 'Farclas terms, ‘plain’) hogshead, so there is less wood on show and more distillery. The nose is like a gentleman’s club at lunchtime: roasting meat, some pipe tobacco, polished wood, and the scent of a freshly-dug garden wafting through the windows. The palate shows slightly more fresh fruitiness (in line with the 1971 cask). There’s decent grip; think treacle this time. Fluxes and changes, which makes it all the more intriguing. £246",386.0,87,50.8,1.0
1877,Dave Broom,"A refill hogshead this time, which when combined with its (relative) youth throws the distillery character into even greater focus. Positively light to start with, a green edge to the dry grass seen in the 1970s and more of the fruity notes hinted at in the 1982. All the time, though, it is anchored by meaty earthiness and that distinctive burnt note. The finish is a little short, but all in all a very appetizing example. £250",392.0,87,51.0,
1878,Dave Broom,"This comes from a refill butt and has a light, paler color. The lack of huge oak interaction has given an amazing freshness; think of freshly-applied plaster, syrup, hot green bracken, a touch of nuttiness. It takes water well, allowing pure, soft fruits to come through, and it is these which become almost syrup-like in the mouth, while never losing Glenfarclas’ central depth and roasty richness in the center. £865",1456.0,87,57.5,1.0
1879,Dave Broom,"Surprisingly pale (you see the issue, Macallan?), but long aging in refill casks helps eliminate the bluntness of oak and can produce aromas that have been reduced and then taken into an exotic realm; here manifested as quince paste and kumquat followed by crystallized and candied fruits. The palate is subtle and soft with light heat, toasted chocolate, white currant, and then overwhelming cherry blossom. Exotic is the word. Bottled for China, but may be given a wider release. £3,000",,87,40.0,1.0
1880,Dave Broom,"One of a trio of new whiskies that have spent time in Glenfiddich’s new solera vats, this will surprise many because of its overt smokiness that’s like a bonfire in a pear orchard. Some ferny greenness adds to the freshness. The reverse happens on the palate, with the smoke being held in check by the soft mouthfeel (which could be solera-enhanced), ripe fruits, and gentle creaminess. (Travel Retail; Asia only, currently.)£70",111.0,87,40.0,1.0
1881,Gavin Smith,"One of two initial releases in Glenfiddich’s Experimental Series, this is a non-chill filtered expression. A vatting of twenty casks, including first-fill bourbon, sherry butts, and port pipes. The nose is fragrant and faintly oriental, with vanilla, Jaffa oranges, and apricots. The palate is full and sweet, with oranges and lemons, fudge, plump sultanas, milk chocolate, and tangy spices. Drying steadily to fruity oakiness in the relatively lengthy finish. £50",62.0,87,47.0,1.0

1883,Gavin Smith,"Wemyss Malts has bottled this 23 year old hogshead-matured example of Glen Garioch from the Aberdeenshire village of Oldmeldrum. Just 322 bottles were yielded by the cask. Cigarette tobacco, brittle toffee, and a hint of aniseed on the nose. Vanilla develops, along with strawberries, apples, and pears. Rich malt, walnuts, cooked apple, and cinnamon on the palate. The spicy finish features old leather and pepper. £105",95.0,87,46.0,1.0
1884,Gavin Smith,"The first of four ‘chapters’ under the Renaissance banner, all of which will consist of spirit made since Glen Garioch reopened in 1997. This 15 year old release has been matured in sherry and bourbon casks, and 12,000 bottles are available. Ginger features on the early, perfumed nose, with soft toffee, oranges, and dates. Milk chocolate on the creamy palate, where the ginger theme continues, along with cinnamon and caramel. The finish offers rich chocolate and orange, which finally fades. £75",108.0,87,51.9,1.0
1885,Gavin Smith,"This malt is actually 36 years old, having spent its first 34 years in a refill hogshead before two years of maturation in a first fill ex-Sauternes cask. The out-turn was 280 bottles. Mellow on the nose, with fresh oranges and apples, developing toffee, and violets. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with dark chocolate, pepper, and discreet tannins. Long in the finish, with fruity oak. £400",637.0,87,43.0,1.0
1886,John Hansell,"While younger Glengoyne whiskies are enjoyable but often fairly straight-forward in flavor, the older expressions develop nicely in depth. Regardless of age, there’s always a creamy maltiness as the foundation of the whisky. For this expression, notes of honey, cookie dough, dry spice notes (vanilla, cinnamon) and soft fruit (citrus, apple) round out the palate. This whisky is clean, polished, and very drinkable. A new addition to the Glengoyne line, and very welcome.",80.0,87,43.0,1.0
1887,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. A very delightful aroma that defies its age, with notes of rich creamy vanilla, exotic tropical fruit, honey, and toasted oak. Rich, mouth coating texture and body. Its flavor starts out like its aroma-creamy vanilla, tropical fruit, honey-then turns dry and becomes very dry, leathery, and oaky on the finish. Soothing, long dry finish.",200.0,87,46.0,1.0
1888,John Hansell,"I enjoy Glenlivet whisky for its subtle elegance, floral notes, along with a delicious ""peaches & cream"" flavor. For this particular whisky, finishing some of the whisky in new French oak barrels adds depth, dried spice (vanilla, clove) and pleasing dryness to the Glenlivet profile. This whisky is more polished and refined than the 12 year old expression it replaces.",50.0,87,40.0,1.0

Palate: Clean and malty up front, becoming dry as it begins to reveal its age, as the maltiness turns into a potpourri of spice and dried fruit. Dry on the finish and spicy-almost peppery. Its finish is big and long for a Glenmorangie whisky.",200.0,87,43.0,1.0

1891,Gavin Smith,"This NAS Glenmorangie contains whisky aged in bourbon casks and some that was ‘extra-matured’ in Spanish oloroso sherry casks, as per Glenmoragie Lasanta. The result is a variant with more of a winter fireside vibe than found in Original. The nose boasts dates, plain chocolate, caramel, and Jaffa oranges. Rich and fruity in the mouth, with more oranges, plus sultanas, roasted chestnuts, cinnamon, and ginger.

1893,John Hansell,"Very bright and lively, with a nice balance of flavors. Zesty fruit (lemon, peach, ripe pineapple, golden raisin) on a bed of layered sweetness (creamy vanilla, light honey, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a hint of coconut). Gently dry, delicately spicy, dried citrus finish. Light enough and with enough zing to enjoy before dinner, but it should stand up well enough after dinner, too. This is a nice whisky, but it shows a lighter, more elegant side of Glenrothes. It doesn’t express the rich, opulent notes often shown in bottlings like the 1972 Vintage, for example.",78.0,87,,1.0
1894,Dave Broom,"Though this has been on the shelves in the UK for a while, its U.S. release has been delayed. It shows a classic mature ‘Rothes nose, mixing moist fruitcake, vanilla, and a tickle of maltiness.

The palate is typically slow with a sparky spiciness and a lick of hazelnut butter to caress your throat. Worth the wait.",322.0,87,43.0,1.0
1895,Dave Broom,"A new NAS, this has a thick, silky nose in classic ‘Rothes style which reminds you of coffee cream icing, hazelnut syrup, semi-dried soft fruits, and horchata. The palate has elegance and poise, with a hint of menthol lifting off into pecan and light grippy oak. Has excellent length and mellow flow.

1896,Gavin Smith,"A comparatively rare independent bottling of what is, in any case, a hard to find single malt. Distilled in 1990, matured in an American oak hogshead (#646), and bottled at cask strength. White pepper, damp earth, violets, cinnamon, and slight saltiness on the nose.

Very long, dry, smoky finish.",500.0,87,42.4,1.0
1906,John Hansell,"Matured in a sherry cask. Chock full of ripe fruit, but still quite feminine in personality. Firm malt foundation, almost buttery in texture, with juicy oak, maple syrup, raspberry (red and black), strawberry, and dates, peppered with gentle spice (cinnamon, ginger). While this is a very enjoyable whisky, I have tasted some excellent Linkwood bottlings, including the standard 12 year old from back in the early 1990s, that brandished less sherry, allowing more of Linkwood’s gentle nature to blossom. Still, the sherry influence here is pristine, and it gives as much as it masks. (430 bottles)£200",325.0,87,58.2,1.0
1907,Dave Broom,"The combination of Linkwood and sherry cask can be to the detriment of such a perfumed whisky. Not here. The nose speaks of caramel toffee, demerara sugar, and while an oaky touch is there it’s light, allowing plump sultanas, rose, and a delightful balsamic cider vinegar note to emerge. The palate is relaxed and gentle, with darker fruits. There’s sufficient body to cope with the tannic squeeze. It needs water to reach ideal balance. Lovely. £65",108.0,87,48.0,1.0

1917,Gavin Smith,"Gordon & MacPhail bottled a 21 year old expression from Scotland’s northernmost mainland distillery for the U.S. market earlier this year. Sweet on the nose, with honey and vanilla; fleetingly, stewed apricots and peaches, plus a hint of caramel. Intensely focused, sweet tropical fruits on the palate, with barley sugar. Becoming nuttier, with an edge of mixed spices. Spice fading to milk chocolate in the medium-length finish, with just a suggestion of brine.",120.0,87,43.0,1.0
1918,Gavin Smith,"Maturation of the Pentland Skerries bottling of the Lighthouse Collection has taken place exclusively in former Spanish sherry casks, which lends the nose rich, dark sherry and Christmas cake notes, caramel and old leather, along with the distillery’s characteristic saltiness, which here comes across as salted peanuts. Full-bodied and slick in the mouth, overt sherry, sultanas, figs, spice, and contrasting brine. Mild maritime notes and autumn fruits combine with prunes and sherry in an accomplished, after-dinner finish. £55/liter",92.0,87,,1.0
1919,Dave Broom,"Here’s a classical Port Ellen, where the intense, even monomaniacal delivery of smoke mixes with damp face flannel, purple smoke, green ferns, and rapeseed oil. Lots of minerality, to the point of being almost flintily uncompromising. Water makes it more naked. The palate is excellent, with an explosion of preserved lemon-accented smokiness, touches of Spanish paprika, a sweet syrupy center, before a massive licorice finish. Peatiness for the purist, but whenever was that different? (2,958 bottles).",2000.0,87,55.0,1.0
1920,John Hansell,"Delicately floral (lavender, rose) and perfumed, with notes of chamomile, hay, soft vanilla and gentle malt. Creamy and soothing, with a gently dry finish. Lots of depth for a lighter weight whisky. A lovely aperitif. I feel Rosebank is freshest and best when it is young. With the distillery closing in 1993, now’s the time to act, and this is one of the better bottlings I’ve tasted.",60.0,87,43.0,1.0
1921,Gavin Smith,"As part of its program to make available single malts from all five of its Scotch whisky distilleries, Bacardi subsidiary John Dewar & Sons has now released a trio of bottlings from Royal Brackla, situated near Nairn in the Scottish Highlands. The 12, 16, and 21 year old expressions are initially available in ten markets, Including the UK, U.S., and Canada.
More restrained on the nose than the 12 and 16 year old variants, with green apples, melons, and damp grass. The palate is silky and refined, with fresh fruits, just a hint of sherry, light spice, and a wisp of smoke. Aniseed and drying old oak in the earthy, lengthy finish.",270.0,87,40.0,1.0
1922,Gavin Smith,"Glansa is described as a “peated whisky cask finish,” with the majority of its unspecified maturation time being spent in first-fill American oak casks. Madeira notes on the nose, with vanilla, honey, and pears. Richly fruity on the palate, with cocoa powder, vanilla, caramel, and mild wood smoke. Dark berries emerge from the background. The dark fruits continue through the lengthy finish, where smokiness increases.",72.0,87,40.0,
1923,John Hansell,"Antique gold color. Mature aromas of creamy vanilla, thick coconut, oak, and a hint of mint. The classic Springbank sea breeze aroma struggles for recognition. Medium body and oily in texture. Flavors deliver what the aroma promises, with additional dry wood spices and a very long finish.",950.0,87,46.0,1.0
1924,John Hansell,"A round of single cask Springers matured completely (not finished) in various wine casks for the U.S. market. All four are solid efforts — it’s really a matter of personal preference. A general comment: most of the single cask releases are matured in some sort of wine or rum cask. While this is nice, I would love to see several single cask, cask strength, and fully-matured ex-bourbon barrel bottlings offered for a change. 

Citrus, exotic wood, and botanicals on the nose and palate. Indeed, there’s a bit of intrigue here. Nice balance, with roasted nuts, pecan pie, and more exotic wood on the finish.",100.0,87,55.4,1.0
1925,Gavin Smith,"This expression from the Campbeltown distillery of Springbank was distilled in April 2000, matured for six years in refill bourbon barrels, and then for another six years in Calvados casks. The outturn was 9,420 bottles. Toffee apples dipped in soft spices on the nose, with a follow through of vanilla. Quite viscous on the palate, with white wine, red peppers, and cinnamon, along with a tang of peat. Lime marmalade and a touch more peat in the relatively dry finish.",105.0,87,52.7,1.0
1926,Gavin Smith,"This is the second ‘Green’ release from Springbank, denoting the use of organic barley, following on from a 12 year old in 2014. This variant has been fully matured in sherry casks and 9,000 bottles are available. White pepper, ozone, and wet sand on the early nose. Ultimately, cocoa powder, baked apple, and sultanas. The palate is initially very sweet and spicy, with salt and fruity sherry developing. The finish is medium to long, warming, with a salty tang.",77.0,87,46.0,1.0
1927,Gavin Smith,"As part of a rebranding of the entire Talisker range, Diageo has brought its Special Releases 25 and 30 year old cask strength expressions into the full-time fold, reduced in strength to 45.8%. Sweet and buttery on the nose; soft fruits and fragrant malt, milk chocolate, and dry, crumbling peat. Citrus fruits (notably lemon), licorice sticks, black pepper, and scorched wood on the palate. Dry and oaky in the lengthy finish, with peat notes and allspice to the end. £300",471.0,87,45.8,1.0
1928,Gavin Smith,"This no age statement Talisker is one of the first “triple matured” (so-named) whiskies exclusive to Friends of The Classic Malts. Successive periods of aging occurred in refill casks, charred American oak hogsheads, and European oak refill casks. Ozone, fresh asphalt, dried fruits, and old leather on the nose. A big pepper hit in the mouth, backed by earthy peat, Elastoplast, vanilla, and citrus fruits. The pepper lasts right to the end in the long, steadily-drying, charcoal-fueled finish. £80",135.0,87,48.0,
1929,Gavin Smith,"A showcase of the wide range of Talisker’s characteristics. Very sweet fruits, vanilla, new leather, and a hint of brine on the nose.

(Travel Retail exclusive)",180.0,87,45.8,
1930,John Hansell,"Deep amber/chestnut/crimson color, suggesting a good dose of sherry cask aging, which the palate confirms. Syrupy notes of fruitcake, burnt fig, raisin, and beeswax are balanced by resinous oak, polished leather, roasted nuts, and dried spice on the finish. The 37 years of oak impact is balanced nicely by the sherry, even if both are a bit extreme for what is normally a more elegant dram.",240.0,87,46.7,1.0
1931,John Hansell,"Straw gold. Aromas of a sweet shop-vanilla, honey, marshmallow, and confectioner’s sugar. Light to medium body, and soft. Clean flavors, which are very malty and honeyed, with notes of marshmallow and vanilla. Gently sweet finish.",36.0,87,40.0,
1932,John Hansell,"Fuller in body, deeper and more complex than the 12 year old (as would be expected). Sweeter fruits (honey-laced citrus, lemon gum drops, and ripe peach) and rum notes marry nicely with dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger). Calming finish. An intelligent use of sherry cask aging.",60.0,87,43.0,1.0
1933,John Hansell,"Bold and spicy, but with enough backbone to handle it. Surely the most intense of the bunch overall. (The 25 year old is dry on the palate -- especially on the finish -- but the 30 year old challenges you the throughout.) There’s plenty of oak here, imparting leather, resin, and dried spice notes (cinnamon, clove, vanilla), but it is rescued by sherried fruit, honeyed citrus, and toffee. A powerful dram.",400.0,87,49.3,1.0
1934,Gavin Smith,"This veteran example of Tomatin was distilled in November 1967 and matured for 45 years in refill butt #9315. The outturn was
175 bottles. Uncompromising dark sherry and treacle notes on the fruity nose, along with gunpowder tea. Big, old sherry notes on the full palate, with raisins, sultanas, and a sprinkling of black pepper. Fruity, notably spicy, and not too drying for its age in a relatively supple finish. £230",353.0,87,51.6,1.0
1935,Gavin Smith,"This vintage expression from Tomatin has been matured in a mix of bourbon and port casks, and is being released in batches. The first comprises 2,500 bottles. The soft, fragrant nose offers strawberries, apricots, honey, and caramel, with a final hint of dry port. Fruit and caramel notes carry over from the nose onto the palate before dark chocolate appears, along with a suggestion of smoke. Subtle oak and ginger in the lengthy finish.",250.0,87,46.0,1.0
1936,Gavin Smith,"Tomatin launched the peated Cù Bòcan expression last year, and follows it with a vintage variant, the result of “…a rare and unintentional production of peated whisky at the distillery on 7th June 1989.” Three bourbon casks yielded 1,080 bottles. Ripe apples and aerosol furniture polish, with a vanilla and sweet woodsmoke backdrop on the nose. Full-bodied, with intense, sweet fruit notes on the palate, and a heathery, smoky kick. Smoky spice and nutty flavors in the ultimately drying finish. £200",337.0,87,53.2,1.0
1939,John Hansell,"Finished 2 years in Quady Black Muscat barrels. Deep amber, ruby hues.

1940,John Hansell,"A blend of bourbon, rye, and peated single malt Scotch whiskies. This is an adaptation of the original release that spent additional time in Hungarian and French oak barrels. The finishing produces a creamier, smoother, more rounded, more mature, and improved version of Campfire, showing notes of honey, vanilla, dark berries, soft mint, and smoke. Distinctive and unique.",60.0,87,46.0,3.0
1953,John Hansell,"Peat smoke indeed, and it dovetails nicely with light toffee, vanilla, anise, charred oak, blackberry, seaweed, kalamata olive, brine, and peppercorn. Well balanced from start to lingering smoke finish, and very exciting. (Exclusive to the U.S.)",130.0,87,46.0,
1954,Dave Broom,"Glenrothes always has a spicy element, but this example ups the ante considerably and, true to the label, it’s fresh-cut ginger root alongside galangal and coriander, a hint of green grass, and even a little bite of jelly babies, alongside black currant leaf. Rothes’ normally languid air is here frothily exuberant, with just sufficient vanilla thickness to offer a brake. Uplifting and good. £107",164.0,87,46.0,
1955,Dave Broom,"Sweet oak and cod liver oil are what greet you, with fleshy, lychee-like fruits
behind. The smoke here is very polite, giving way to fruit jelly cubes and
peaches, to develop alongside crisp apple. The palate is clean with nutty oak, with
the smoke continuing in the background, offering an extra layer of complexity.
Fresh, belying its age, while it has typical tongue-coating oiliness it remains
understated. Caol Ila basking in the summer sun. (U.S. only)",230.0,87,46.0,1.0
1956,Dave Broom,"The nose is sweet (think barley sugar/boiled sweets) with little bits of wheat chaff flying around in the background with dried flower petals and drying cut grass. Opens dramatically with water into almond milk/horchata and flowers. The palate is sweet and lifted with those gentle florals to the fore. Instead of Tormore’s normal nagging rigidity, this flows sweetly over the tongue, leaving fruit leather, stewed rhubarb, and with water, rosewater and fresh wild strawberry. A lovely Tormore! £118",189.0,87,46.0,1.0
1957,Dave Broom,"This is Mortlach in musing mode. An aroma that initially brings to mind a woolen mill, then opens into sweet spice, light syrup, with the sense of the distillery’s weight always present. A rippling kind of muscularity with some rapeseed oil. With water the palate starts lighter and more fruity than you’d expect, then comes rooty weight with, yes, a distinctly gingery slant. Water shows more beeswax/honeycomb. Substantial and spicy. £85",133.0,87,46.0,
1958,Gavin Smith,"Released in Wemyss Malts’ Cask Strength Single Cask Releases range. This expression of Clynelish was aged in a refill hogshead. Initially, big coffee and ginger notes on the nose. Sweet orchard fruits develop in time along with a pinch of table salt. Very sweet and spicy on the palate with icing sugar and soft toffee. Salt, white pepper, and light oak in a long, spicy finish.

1962,Davin de Kergommeaux,"After more than 60 years in cask this dignified, old-time Canadian Club flaunts its age with wood and faintly bitter oak tannins. Initially, the nose is closed, then opens into cedar with slightly musty wet paper and just hints of fruit. The fruit is big but undefined on the palate with overtones of brisk Epsom salts, sweet sandalwood, and blistering spices. Teasing hints of varnish, clean wood, and oat flakes linger long into the finish. (Australia only) A$195",150.0,87,40.0,4.0
1967,John Hansell,"Aged in both refill and new bourbon casks. The new bourbon casks are evident, and I think it adds richness, vibrancy, and perceived maturity (which I like) when compared to the previous Summer 2010 release. Very pale in color. Brooding, with licorice root, coal tar, bacon fat, damp peat, bright fruit (citrus and pear), and intriguing botanicals, all on a soothing bed of vanilla malt. Smoky, briny finish. I’m still amazed how this very young whisky can taste so mature. Well done!",63.0,87,46.0,1.0
1968,Dave Broom,"The only Islay distillery not on the coast — and the most westerly on the island — Kilchoman is reviving the tradition of farm distilling, and this limited edition release uses locally grown Optic barley malted at the distillery. Very creamy, with some stewed apple, green banana, and (when diluted) sponge cake mix. The smoke develops on the palate, adding an earthy note. Rich, with some clove and licorice on the finish. Well worth a look.",100.0,87,50.0,1.0
1969,Dave Broom,"Here you have the sweetness of rising bread alongside scallop and wreathes of smoke, all lit by west coast sunshine; the peat isn’t dank, but bright and flaming. The palate is sweetly seductive before the smoke begins to come through, then it sweetens like golden syrup, then the shore comes back, and so it continues. Water ups the impact of each, so be careful, as it can then seem disconnected. Sweet, beachy, smoky. Very Islay.",92.0,87,50.0,1.0
1970,Dave Broom,"This strikes me as being the most overtly smoky of Kilchoman’s recent bottlings, and also the sweetest. Intense and very forward, there’s baked apple, humidor notes, honeydew melon, fresh shellfish. Water brings out a putty-like youthfulness, so take it neat. The palate is amazingly sweet (think golden syrup), then the smoke folds itself over. A good—and well-priced—introduction for newcomers.(World of Whiskies UK Travel Retail only) £45",76.0,87,46.0,1.0
1971,John Hansell,"So nice to see this whisky available here in the U.S. again. A more mature, more sherried expression of the standard Royal Lochnagar. Rich, silky, and sweet, with molasses, nutty toffee, old demerara pot still rum, caramelized fig, marmalade, and juicy oak. More subtle notes of honeyed ginger, coffee grounds, and tobacco leaf add complexity. A soothing post-prandial dram.",210.0,87,43.0,1.0
1972,Dave Broom,"Each independent bottler has its own signature style. Adelphi’s is about relaxed, contemplative drams with rich maturity and a certain seriousness. Here you see this, plus crème brûlée, sitting in front of a sandalwood backdrop with a bunch of basil mint thrown in. The opening is slow, and while the inherent sweet nature of the distillery is there, hazelnuttish oak helps to add structure and stops any flabbiness from intruding. A luscious dram. £99",158.0,87,56.8,1.0
1973,Gavin Smith,"This offers an enticing nose of honey, malt, and barley sugar—sweet and floral. Peaches in cream on the palate, a suggestion of madeira, milk chocolate, and Brazil nuts. Cocoa, citrus fruits, and light oak in the medium-length finish. Value pick",25.0,87,40.0,1.0
1980,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"The quality is instantly discernable, even as the rye grain takes a back seat to layered aromas of cherry and dark currant, coupled with sweet notes of brown sugar and treacle underscored by fresh oak, toasted spices, and dark chocolate. Beyond its richness and depth, this beams bright and lively on the palate as grapefruit zest meets rye bread, followed by a finish of harmonized sweetness and spice. Aged 3 years in American oak; finished in French oak. (Distillery only)",64.0,87,46.5,3.0
1981,Fred Minnick,"There’s a marriage here, one of perfect harmony; fruit, floral, spice, sweet, and expressive toasted oak. Then the broad genres become specific: the fruit is cherries; the floral, a hint of lavender; the sweet, an array of toffee, caramel, and vanilla, until its spice complexity kicks in, showing allspice, white pepper, Spanish anise, and nutmeg. Its proof never shows, but the medium finish is just a touch short to make this truly special. (New Hampshire only)",47.0,87,60.0,2.0
1982,Fred Minnick,"At first it’s a smorgasbord of cotton candy, vanilla, caramel, tapioca pudding, honey, and salted caramel. Then spice-bomb reality sets in with nutmeg, cinnamon, anise, and ginger. Finally, the spice gives way to caramel over cornbread, malt, and Cinnamon Toast Crunch. The medium finish ends what was developing into a great whiskey; alas, much is to be desired.",130.0,87,62.5,2.0
1983,Fred Minnick,"Confectionary goodies all around. Vanilla, caramel with milk and chocolates: dark, Mexican, sweet, and white. Lots of chocolate. It’s soft and gentle, with zero spice, only rich chocolate and caramel with hints of grain and fruit, but this richness cannot be overstated. If you love chocolate and caramel, this is your dream bourbon. It finishes long and strong with a hint of—you guessed it—chocolate. Price is per 375ml",50.0,87,45.0,2.0
1988,Fred Minnick,"No two Angels Envy Cask Strengths offer the same aromas. Here, cotton candy, honey, roasted pecan, and chocolate malt. Then a strange turn on the palate; roasted corn, dark chocolate, honey syrup, mashed cherry, caramel, Scotch ale, and cinnamon. Smoked cherrywood, hickory, milk chocolate, strawberry preserves, orange peel, and peach cobbler. What were once multiple fruit flavors now become a single cherry turnover with a sprinkle of cinnamon. It finishes medium with cherry.",180.0,87,62.3,2.0
1989,Gavin Smith,"This is the latest in an ongoing series of releases of whisky distilled at the Campbeltown distillery of Glengyle, and now aged 8 years. Just 9,000 bottles are available. The nose is full, with over-ripe oranges, warm honey, and custard. On the palate, the oranges are fresher and livelier, with vanilla, hard toffee, and a slightly citric fruit edge to balance the sweetness. That sweetness carries over into the spicy finish, which is quite lengthy, with a lick of licorice. £35",55.0,87,46.0,1.0
1990,Gavin Smith,"Having released four previous “work in progress” expressions of Kilkerran, 2013 sees the launch of two editions, one matured in sherry casks and the other in bourbon barrels. The sherry-aged variant yields overripe green grapes and figs on the nose, followed by honey and plain chocolate, while the palate is quite full, softly fruity, with soft toffee and a hint of brine. The finish dries significantly, with cocoa powder, licorice, and lots of spice. £38",58.0,87,46.0,1.0
1991,Gavin Smith,"The latest releases from Glengoyne distillery are 10 year olds, one matured in sherry wood and one in bourbon barrels, as was the case with release 5. 9,000 bottles are available globally. Initially savory on the nose, slightly earthy, with sherry, new leather, lemonade, and a hint of ozone. Spicy and zesty, with developing stewed fruits, dark chocolate, and deep sherry notes on the palate. The finish is long and persistently spicy, mildly smoky, with quite dry sherry notes.",60.0,87,46.0,1.0
1992,Gavin Smith,"The 2015 Work in Progress releases are the last before the single malt becomes a permanently-available 12 year old in 2016. 6,000 bottles are available. Creamy malt, marzipan, and vanilla on the nose, with pears, instant coffee, linseed, and a hint of table salt. Soft and slightly oily on the warm, spicy palate, with immediate ripe apples, caramel, and slight smokiness. Long and slowly drying, with a touch of aniseed and brine.",85.0,87,54.1,1.0
1993,John Hansell,"Soft, elegant, and nicely rounded, with honeyed orchard fruit and gentle spice on a bed of vanilla and caramel. Very versatile; a pleasing, unchallenging bourbon to suit most moods and situations. I actually like it better than the new, older 10 year old expression (reviewed in this issue), because it is so beautifully balanced.",25.0,87,45.0,2.0
1994,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The warehouses at Brown-Forman’s Canadian Mist Distillery in Collingwood, Ontario hold some rare beauties, including this one, the result of an experiment using a mashbill rather than processing the individual grains separately. Malty on the nose, with hard candies, Jujubes, and vague sour-mash bread notes. Palate is floral, gently perfumed, with sweet vanilla, mild peppers, barrel tones, and mildly pulling tannins. Long, pleasantly hot, cereal-rich finish. (Canada only) $44 CAD",34.0,87,45.0,4.0
1995,Lew Bryson,"Not burning my nose; mild bread and vanilla aromas. Peppy stuff, but not explosive on the palate; easily held five seconds on the tongue, but fiery once it gets aerated. Sweet grain with a big saw-toothed edge of cinnamon and hot vanilla, and a circling brim of zingy mint that tightens toward the finish. Pretty interesting stuff for wheat whiskey; a more expressive nose would seal the deal. Price is per 375ml.",35.0,87,60.0,3.0
1996,Gavin Smith,"Following on from the earlier 8 year old expression of this triple distilled Campbeltown malt, the 12 year old first appeared in August 2009 and nicely illustrates the developments brought about by its continuing maturation. Rich on the nose, with a clear sherry influence, along with toffee, marzipan, apricots, and milk chocolate. This is a substantial and well integrated dram, with malt, almonds, cocoa, and spice on the palate, while the long, spicy finish offers more chocolate, soft fruits, and coffee.",80.0,87,46.0,1.0
1997,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in June 2007 and bottled in October 2016, this expression spent 6 years in first-fill bourbon casks, then 3 years in Barolo wine casks. Fresh on the early nose; herbaceous, with pineapple and a hint of oil. Big in the mouth, with white pepper, more pineapple, dried fruits, and coconut milk. Drying to tannins, with dark berries in the lengthy, minty finish. (10,800 bottles)",123.0,87,57.9,1.0
1998,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Canadian whisky makers tend to mash their grains separately, then blend them as mature spirits, allowing the individual grains to shine. This all-wheat whiskey was matured in used barrels, further accentuating these grain flavors. Sweet and light on the nose, the palate overflows with toffee and vanilla. Then, a vaguely earthy dryness follows glowing white pepper. Robust without the weight of corn, this luscious sipping whiskey provides guiltless pleasure with oodles of butterscotch custard, orange soda, and tingling spices.",79.0,87,50.0,4.0
2000,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"This light-hued bourbon is bright and airy, with tropical fruit aromas of papaya and lychee, vanilla, and sweet lemon curd. While not especially bourbon-like it’s interesting and super-likeable for its Bit-O-Honey candy and pleasingly nutty notes. Last reviewed in 2011.",49.0,87,40.0,3.0
2002,Lew Bryson,"This 100% rye whiskey was distilled at Fremont Mischief, and aged in oak. The flinty-minty rye spice blows right out at you, with a ripple of oaky vanilla. Beautiful youthful rye spirit, with crackling rye spiciness, sweet floral notes, and hints of horehound candy. The finish is a bit disappointing — fading somewhat quickly — but mainly because the rest of it's so good. Great price for mellowness in this category, too.",33.0,87,40.0,3.0
2003,Davin de Kergommeaux,"With Small Batch, Wiser’s offers a taste of the quality of its more expensive Legacy to those with a limited whisky budget. This is big whisky at a very affordable price. Cinnamon, cloves, and candied ginger temper glowing hot pepper, while oak caramels and vanilla bolster sweet dark fruit. The earthiness of rye intersects with the fragrance of river plants and wet slate. Red cedar and fresh sawdust round out a clean, expressive palate. Lots of weight. C$33",33.0,87,43.4,
2004,Davin de Kergommeaux,"“Boiling the hops made them too bitter,” says Wiser’s master blender, Don Livermore. After more than 100 attempts he cracked the fruity-floral-hops code by “dry hopping” – adding Bravo hops to the finished whisky. Searing spices energize the earthy, grassy aroma of a freshly-mown fall meadow. Caramels—some sweet, some burnt—with early blushes of coffee or milk chocolate slowly fade into a vaguely bitter finish. (Canada only) C$29",22.0,87,40.0,4.0
2005,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"The concentration here is impressive, as dates and raisins meet leathery oak that smells of a dusty tack shop, joined by some lovely cinnamon, clove, and spearmint. The intensity on the rich palate is face-melting, hot, and muscular. Sweet flan, caramel corn, and vivid spice succumb to a finish built for oak lovers, drying and a bit tannic, bringing the molten sweet flavors to an end too soon.",80.0,87,64.6,3.0
2006,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Skilled whisky makers know many different ways to achieve a particular flavor profile. So when someone mentions rye, don’t ask the percentage, ask how it was made. Why? Because sometimes Alberta Springs is made entirely from rye grain, and sometimes it isn’t. And not even trained tasters can tell. Crisp yet

2011,John Hansell,"Triple distilled. (Twice in Kentucky, once in Virginia.) Gritty and gripping on the palate, showing dry, vibrant oak spice (particularly warming cinnamon and mouth-coating vanilla), but with candied fruit, toffee, pot still rum, and caramel-coated nuts to keep it interesting. Polished leather and tobacco on the finish. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)",50.0,87,50.0,2.0
2015,Dave Broom,"The latest bottling of “Breath” is like a whisky smuggler’s tale. There’s the smell of old waxed walking boots, wet moss, damp earth, crushed bog foliage — heather, bog myrtle — burlap sacking, and a hastily smothered fire. The smoke is well controlled all the way, which helps to allow its scents to run over bitter coffee and a balancing central sweetness. Robust, hairy, and uncompromising, this is less of a breath and more of a roar. £65",101.0,87,56.6,1.0
2016,Lew Bryson,"After twelve years, it’s time for a revisit. No age statement; aged in a variety of woods. The whiskey is a pale gold and has a pleasantly sweet and layered nose; honeycomb, dried apricot, sugar cookies, and hints of an ice wine richness. It’s a bit hot for 43%, which robs the palate of some complexity, but that honeyed fruit and cookie is there in the mouth, too. Overall, quite nice indeed.",70.0,87,43.0,3.0
2017,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Exhibits the floral, rose petal, and fresh meadow character often found in St. George malts. The palate pours with white peach and apricot, coupled with warm cereal notes.

2018,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Until it arrived in U.S. stores earlier this year, Gibson’s 12 year old was highly prized by American cross-border whisky shoppers. They made it a duty free staple and no wonder. This is classic, old-style Canadian whisky. Seamlessly integrated spicy white pepper, refreshing bitterness, and succulent butterscotch, all burnished with clean oak, cinnamon, cloves, and simmering ginger. It has the creamy body of crème brûlée brightened by a sprinkling of blackstrap molasses. C$22",22.0,87,40.0,4.0
2022,Dave Broom,"Startlingly herbal. Penetrating, lifted, and aromatic with dill, mint, and in time, celery leaf and lovage. Smoke is akin to freshly-laid tarmac with some sweet seaweed behind. Lively and quite different to the official bottling. Water brings unripe pineapple, clove, sugared almond, and horseradish. This has typical Kilchoman sweet creaminess in the center. Water brings out flavors of nettles, and saltiness. £69",117.0,87,55.5,1.0
2029,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"A true American single malt; the impression of new charred barrels distinguishes this from its Old World counterparts, while the creamed honey, caramel, and candied nuts keep the wood in check. On the palate, the wood influence delivers big vanilla and hints of smoky char, coupled with nicely concentrated flavors of Turkey Golden table syrup, fruit, and spice. A nice rendition of New World single malt, showing proof and gusto.",80.0,87,45.0,3.0
2035,John Hansell,"Aged over 6 years, this is a rather feminine version of Booker’s. It’s sweet, relatively gentle compared to previous releases, and quite fragrant (bordering on perfumed—especially on the nose). Creamy vanilla coats the palate, with suggestions of coconut macaroon and marzipan. Dried spice (cinnamon, mint) and drying oak on the finish keep the sweetness in check.",60.0,87,63.5,2.0
2036,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Lovely aromas of charred toast, nut bread, biscuits, fresh grain, rye spice, and some grassiness give way to a palate-coating sweetness, including malted milk balls, cocoa, and dark baking chocolate. The finish offers fine balance, with cherry fruit nicely matched with drying oak tannins and laced with sandalwood and spices. Vatted from 23 barrels, primarily bourbon and rye, though the malt component offers great backbone.",50.0,87,50.0,
2037,Lew Bryson,"This one’s calling to me; I can smell the rich nose from a foot away. Freshly-sieved cornmeal, sharp oak aromas, and spice cake in the nose. Good body, a bit warm (expected from the proof), and a mouthful of
cracked corn, piecrust, sun-warmed meadow-mint, and vanilla. Finish is firm and leaner than the mouth, drawn out nicely. Belle Meade is currently sourced from MGP; Green Brier hopes to have their distillery up this year.",39.0,87,45.2,3.0
2038,Lew Bryson,"Sweet, warm, grassy, like a sunny day on the prairie. The alcohol heat quickly yields to a grass/mint sweetness—this is high-rye stuff—that picks up some oily rye notes as it slides into a finish that is both bitter and sweet without being bittersweet; the components remain discrete, not blending. Quite nice, and reasonably priced. Sourced whiskey (with the 95% rye mashbill that’s an LDI/MGP signature).",35.0,87,45.0,3.0
2039,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A growing number of Canadian craft distillers are making Scotch-style single malt whisky, and several, including Still Waters, do quite a good job of it. Round, leafy, cereal notes on the nose give rise to a granular fruitiness, delicate oak, caramels, and glowering peppers on the palate. It’s beautifully balanced, lush, and mouth-filling, and though delicious now, with a few more years it would be stellar. Lovely hot peppers, sweet grassiness, yellow fruit, and a long spicy finish.",70.0,87,46.0,4.0
2043,Lew Bryson,"Now here’s an interesting mashbill: 73% malted rye, 13.5% chocolate malt, and 13.5% cherry-smoked malt. Nose is an arresting mix of bitter, grassy rye and smoky dark chocolate; abrupt, but it grows on you. It’s all there on the palate, too: rye oil, sweet malt, cherry smoke, pipe tobacco, raw oak. This is rambunctious stuff, with an intense but not hot finish, a very craft-beer whiskey. Unlike similarly shouty bottlings, this one has something to say as it shouts.",50.0,87,49.0,3.0
2045,Dave Broom,"Full gold. Big, robust, and sweetly fragrant, with honeysuckle, stewing elderflower. There’s some oak, but it’s not dominant. The palate starts creamy, then there’s some caramel toffee with good distillery character. It melds freshness with the extra weight gained by gentle maturation. There’s coconut and cassia on the end. You lose the sweetness with water, but you get more blossom and oak. Personally I’d go for it neat and sip slowly as a perfect summer dram. £130",190.0,87,49.3,1.0
2046,Dave Broom,"Soft and direct. The initial impression is of birthday cake icing with marzipan beneath, then comes preserved lemon, greengage, and discreet maltiness. It becomes more scented (linden/privet blossom) in time. The palate is a little strong initially, then a hint of coconut. Improves further with water, showing a fascinating, subtle evolution: herbal with iris flowers. A classy dram from an overlooked distillery. Check it out. £53",83.0,87,48.4,1.0
2047,Gavin Smith,"This Glenturret was bottled in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular series at 28 years old. After maturation in a single refill hogshead it was released in early 2016. Malt, milk chocolate, and honey on the pleasing, mature, rounded nose. Figs and sultanas develop in time. Smooth and rich on the palate with more malt, cocoa powder, and soft spices. Very long in the finish with quite insistent spice, citrus fruit, cloves, and sweet oak. (168 bottles) £105",151.0,87,51.5,1.0
2050,Geoffrey Kleinman,"From an undisclosed North Highland distillery, aged in a refill sherry hogshead. The impact of the sherry is clear, with ripe blackberry and peach. A floral, sweet, clover honey note rounds out a deliciously lush mouthfeel. This lushness is well balanced by a spicy mid-palate that features black pepper, ginger, and strong salinity that help provide some real depth. A long and slightly dry finish wraps up a solid whisky. (U.S. only)",120.0,87,56.1,1.0
2051,Geoffrey Kleinman,"This cask strength, port cask-aged whisky comes from an undisclosed distillery near Aberlour. The impact of the port cask is unmistakable, with a nose that is deeply fruity with dried apricot, blackberry jam, honey, and malt. On the palate these rich sweet fruit notes are well balanced by black pepper, clove, salt, honey, and a touch of dark chocolate. The underlying proof also helps counterbalance the sweet fruit and drives a medium length and slightly dry finish. (U.S. only)",110.0,87,57.7,1.0
2052,Geoffrey Kleinman,"BenRiach releases of this age are often peated or in a special barrel; here, we have an unpeated, non-barrel finish release. The nose is inviting, with Honeycrisp apple, toffee, malt, and a touch of oak. A very flavorful entry presents lush toffee, apple, malt, and ginger. The spice increases in the mid-palate, as well as the heat, but we don’t get much added complexity. A long, flavorful, and slightly dry finish round out a very tasty but ultimately simplistic whisky. (U.S. only)",140.0,87,54.3,1.0
2053,Geoffrey Kleinman,"An Islay single malt of unknown origin aged in a bourbon barrel showcases many of the classic notes of a peated malt of this age with smoke, iodine, paste, and oak. On the palate the smoky peat unfolds nicely, as it’s exquisitely balanced by honey, salt, and caramel. The smoke intensifies in the mid-palate but never loses its balance with the sweeter undertones. A dry, long, smoky finish caps off a well-integrated and very enjoyable mystery malt. (U.S. only)",145.0,87,54.6,1.0
2054,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in October 1995 and aged in refill hogshead #8937. Slightly earthy on the early nose, with allspice, vanilla, then creamy toffee and caramel notes emerge. Big, boiled sweet notes on the full palate: nutmeg, soft toffee, and aniseed. Long and drying in the finish, with chili spice. (261 bottles)",170.0,87,52.7,1.0
2055,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in March 1992, this single cask expression was matured in a refill hogshead (#1266). The nose yields heather in bloom, a hint of machine oil, vanilla, orange fondant creams, and a wisp of sweet wood smoke. Smooth on the palate, with creamy orange notes, gentle spice, and, ultimately, soft peat smoke. The finish is relatively long, with Jaffa orange, black pepper, and drying oak. (209 bottles)",345.0,87,46.8,1.0
2056,Gavin Smith,"The nose is muted, with gentle orchard fruits, subtle malt, nougat, and nutty toffee. The palate, by contrast, is bold and offers big fresh fruit notes, notably zesty tangerines, along with crème brûlée. Dry peat notes follow. Earthy peat smoke and white pepper with a citrus tang in the long finish. (230 bottles)",135.0,87,54.5,
2057,Gavin Smith,"Part of Signatory’s Un-Chillfiltered Collection, this was distilled on February 25, 2005 and bottled on November 25, 2015. Initially a little earthy on the nose, then more fragrant, with orange blossom, nutmeg, and a hint of polished oak. Oily and rounded on the palate, with supple sherry influences: prunes, dates, more orange, and tingling spices, plus toffee. The finish is medium to long, with a hint of smoke and lingering spicy Jaffa orange notes.",78.0,87,46.0,1.0
2058,Dave Broom,"Golden, lifted, and aromatic. The fleshy ripeness of the 13 year old is still there, but that little sulfur edge has now gone, revealing the ripe fruits massing underneath. Now you find pineapple and light chalk. The flowers have become daffodils and bluebells rather than lily, along with a soft, vanilla ice cream plumpness. Sweet and full, and just a shade lighter than the 13 year old. Muscly, but sweet; that’s the paradox of the Craigellachie character. £83",132.0,87,46.0,1.0
2059,Gavin Smith,"Gordon & MacPhail’s latest bottling from Macduff distillery is a year 2000 distillation, matured in refill sherry hogsheads. American cream soda and light spices on the nose, with honey, and white pepper development. Ultimately, rum and raisin fudge. Smooth and supple in the mouth, with apple peel, soft fino sherry, and nutmeg. The finish is medium in length, with spicy fruit notes. £45",76.0,87,46.0,1.0
2060,Gavin Smith,"This expression from Aberfeldy was distilled in April 1995 and bottled in January 2014 after maturation in refill, remade sherry hogsheads (casks #2,488, 2,489, and 2,491). The nose is floral, with ginger and developing milk chocolate. Progressively sweeter, with slight sherry and vanilla notes. The palate is silky and sweet, with banoffee pie, peaches, and spicy oak. The finish is long, with cocoa powder and more spiced oak. £60",95.0,87,55.8,1.0
2061,Gavin Smith,"This expression of Glen Grant has been matured in refill bourbon casks and is arguably more characterful than the distiller’s own variant of the same age. Ripe orchard fruits on the nose, with honey and cinder toffee. The palate is light to medium in weight, offering more fresh fruit notes, vanilla, milk chocolate, and a hint of ginger. The nutty finish dries with just a hint of smoke.",50.0,87,40.0,1.0
2062,Gavin Smith,"This expression from Scapa in Orkney was distilled in 2001 and matured in first-fill bourbon barrels. Tropical fruit and butterscotch on the sweet, light nose, with very slight smokiness on the early palate, along with spicy, milky cocoa, hazelnuts, and more tropical fruit. The finish is medium in length, with a hint of char. An easy-drinking, nicely balanced dram at a good price.",65.0,87,43.0,1.0
2063,Gavin Smith,"This unspecified single malt has been bottled non-chill filtered in single cask format. Maturation took place in a barrel that formerly contained Islay single malt. Initially earthy on the nose, with potato skins, salt, and white pepper. Time in the glass teases out fruity, caramel sweetness. The palate is very sweet and zesty, with orange sherbet, along with a nicely integrated maritime note which becomes more pronounced. The finish is spicy and mildly medicinal. £50",84.0,87,46.0,1.0
2066,Lew Bryson,"Label: “BeanBall Bourbon – Tennessee Straight Bourbon Whiskey.” Believed to be from Dickel, but no confirmation; just the huge cracked corn component in the nose, which should be all you need. My, that’s tasty as it spreads like warm oil over the tongue, hot corn spirit spiked hard with oak. Good oak, dried corn, and a snap of mint in the finish. Nice selection…and interesting labeling in light of the recent Tennessee whiskey definition squabbles. Sourced whiskey.",45.0,87,50.0,2.0
2067,Lew Bryson,"Made with green malt: not kilned, taken just as it’s ready from malting to be fermented and distilled, timing that accounts for some of the price and limited availability of this unique spirit. Smells like a shed full of drying herbs and flowers; vegetal souls transmigrated to the bottle. Herbal, European, restrained barrel character, headily vaporous in the mouth. An invigorating elixir I’d like to keep handy in a small flask; a little goes a long way. Fascinatingly different. Price is per 375 ml.",60.0,87,45.0,3.0
2068,Lew Bryson,"Coppersea uses New York grain (75% rye, 25% malt), mashed in wooden tanks and distilled in direct-fire copper pot stills. This unaged spirit is highly aromatic: hay, sunny meadow, hints of lavender and tansy, honeydew melon. Brilliantly herbal flavors, sweet grass, gobs of white pepper, lemon balm, and a long-lingering sweet heat. Almost more like an eau de vie than a whiskey, with layer upon layer to discover. Heretical thought: this might be wasted on a barrel.",50.0,87,45.0,3.0
2076,Lew Bryson,"“Local heirloom rye grains” are distilled (less than half a mile from the Monongahela River) in a copper alembic, aged 14 months, bottled at cask strength. Has a beautiful ruddy glow. Clean, focused nose of fresh rye grain, spicy-sweet with a nip of bitter oil in the back. Not a barn-burner, even at 56%, but brimful with rye spice, rye oiliness, and rye mint, and not over-oaked, either, as the finish closes evenly. A bit direct, but very nicely done!",65.0,87,56.0,3.0
2078,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"This holds real promise for the scotch lover. Interesting vanillin oak, peaty phenols, and adhesive bandage balance the generous, sweet malt foundation. Robust on the palate, but far from fiery, the mouth coating peat takes charge of the marshmallow-sweet malt, before dusty cocoa and dark chocolate win out across the long finish. Like other Westland efforts, this tries hard on many fronts and succeeds on some. It’s hard to deduce what the Oregon Quercus Garryana oak actually brings to the whole.",125.0,87,56.2,3.0
2081,Dave Broom,"Fruits are to the fore here, super ripe, and dark in hue: think of plump plums, sweet black grapes, and hedgerow berries. That said, it is never heavy, as if it’s just the aromatics of the fruits which have been preserved. In time, some dried flowers emerge. The palate is equally sweet, with a little caramel and spice. It fades gently. Impressive and well worth a look. I wonder whether the new Dalmunach distillery will produce anything like this? £213",325.0,87,48.0,
2083,Lew Bryson,"A nose like Big Red gum—juicy-sweet cinnamon—and some sweet dough, with sharp alcohol heat. Hot as expected on the tongue, but exciting: more cinnamon and sweetness—like snickerdoodles—with wet corn, a touch of bitter oil, and hot spearmint. Adding water eases the heat, and brings out the oak. Good stuff, if a bit simple. Sourced whiskey.",80.0,87,58.4,2.0
2084,Lew Bryson,"Less driving aroma than Batch 005; lower floor? Both are a mashbill of 70/26/4% corn/rye/malt. More corn and cinnamon and bread dough in the nose here. A lot like 005, but more sweet cornmeal, less spice, less height in the mouth, and the finish is sweeter and longer. Might be that farmer’s younger brother; this one’s only 8 years old. Still good, a bit less complex. Sourced whiskey.",90.0,87,61.45,2.0
2085,Fred Minnick,"5 years is when bourbon really starts developing complexity, and you find the beginnings of greatness here, with saltwater taffy, vanilla custard, citrus, corn pudding, and a healthy dose of cinnamon. Its proof offers satisfying warmth that quickly turns to spice. Medium finish gracefully gives a hint of warm vanilla icing. In an age of barrel strength bourbons, this is a good one, but lacks complexity for higher praise. Sourced whiskey.",85.0,87,61.2,2.0
2086,Lew Bryson,"Clear and unaged in a tall, thin, grappa-like 375 ml bottle; “Afterburner” is a bit intimidating as a name. “Distilled from grain and fermented with hops.” Nose of new make and hops, with aromas of rhubarb and fresh blood. Herbal and refreshing on the palate, bitter with the hops, a certain resiny stickiness to it. Much more than just new make; almost tonic-like. Nicely done!",25.0,87,50.5,3.0
2087,Lew Bryson,"NJOY Spirits makes this 100% rye from locally-grown rye, some of which they grow themselves…in Florida! It is approximately 1 year old, and quite dark. There’s a medicinal, dark pit fruit nose, overripe plum with some lighter red plum notes, a soft sweetness around the edges, and a hint of small barrel oak. Wow. Surprisingly smooth, up-front rye flavors, cushioned with a pleasantly odd sweetness with notes of cocoa and a soft rye finish. Intriguing.",54.0,87,50.0,3.0
2090,Dave Broom,"Smoky, yes, but the effect is more shore-like: on the beach, hot sand, wood smoke, and a faint hint of balloons…there must be a party going on. In addition you get olive oil, preserved lemon, and eucalyptus. The palate is thick with strawberry sweeties that push back against the peat. Water calms things (suggesting this would work with soda), while the finish sees the campfire emit more smoke. £45",72.0,87,50.0,1.0
2091,Gavin Smith,"Ladyburn malt distillery was part of William Grant’s Girvan grain distilling complex in Ayrshire from 1966 to 1975. It was located close to where Ailsa Bay now stands. This veteran bottling is mature and rounded on a nose of sweet pears, nectarines, subtle vanilla, and a hint of old hemp. Fresh fruit and lively spice on the early palate, with worn leather and malt.  The fruit lingers through the very long finish with oak, licorice, and slightly bitter citrus notes.",1750.0,87,40.0,1.0
2093,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"With 4 years 3 months of age, this is a fine selection, with poached pear, stone fruit, brown sugar, and floral aromas nicely integrated. At cask strength, it serves up a bold and spicy punch to the palate, with peppery notes that quickly overpower the dried corn, treacle, and caramel sweetness. A little water allows that sweetness to shine through before the slightly tannic finish of drying oak and black walnut. (Lincoln Road Package Store exclusive)",60.0,87,61.5,
2094,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Assorted mashes and barrels ensure each batch of Two Brewers malt whisky is unique. When mature, about 7 years later, these are blended into multi-layered whiskies. Sweet, crisp nose, then Cheerios, dry grain, and fresh malt. Vague herbal tones balance hints of ripe fruit. Bright palate with gingery peppers sprinkled on fall fruit—soft apples, plums, peaches. Lush body, then a slight woody, tannic pull. (Canada only) C$95",74.0,87,46.0,4.0
2096,Gavin Smith,"Diurachs are the inhabitants of the Isle of Jura, and this single malt named in their honor is initially matured in bourbon casks before 2 years of finishing in amoroso sherry casks. Floral and honeyed on the nose, with caramel, pine, and spicy dark chocolate. Sweet and oily on the palate, where the chocolate changes from plain to milk, with vanilla and delicate cloves. Darkening chocolate and drying oak in the finish.",65.0,87,43.0,1.0
2097,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Distillery owner Patrick Evans grows much of the distillery’s barley on his 380-acre farm on the shores of British Columbia’s Straits of Georgia. In 2011 Evans and distiller James Marinus fired up the distillery’s two Forsyths copper pot stills. The resulting single malt is creamy, malty, and slightly minty. Citrus fruits, peach pits, and stimulating white pepper slowly fade into gentle barrel notes. (Canada only) $85 CAD",66.0,87,46.0,4.0
2099,Davin de Kergommeaux,"If you close your eyes, the first whiff will carry you into a shoe store with its clean leather and vague, sweet, waxy polishes. A beautifully constructed, fruity, creamy, full-bodied whisky that shows hints of dry cereal, ripe red fruit, orange liqueur, and early on, something vaguely like grape tannins. Clean sparkling peppers enhance the lush fruits, while almost citrus-like barrel notes cleanse the palate with their slightly pulling, oaky finish. Very tasty. (Canada only) $45 CAD",34.0,87,40.0,4.0
2101,Gavin Smith,"Another expression from anCnoc’s first batch of Peaty Collection releases, this has the lowest phenolic level of the trio, at 11 ppm. Initial peatiness on the nose gives way to sliced pineapple, nougat, and spicy vanilla. Ripe apple, milk chocolate, and honey emerge out of soft peatiness on the palate. Old leather and a hint of spice in the medium-length finish.",65.0,87,46.0,1.0
2106,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Mild peat smoke wafts into the room as soon as you pull the cork. A big fruity nose ripe with red apples and hints of ether rides the peat. Sweetish spices glow with hints of chocolate, then fade slowly into typical malty tones that in turn become dry cereal notes. A flash of soapiness on first sip never returns, but lessens an otherwise beautiful young whisky. Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$70",56.0,87,43.0,4.0
2107,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Single malt whisky from British Columbia-grown and malted barley, matured in bourbon barrels, then finished in wine barrels from Black Sage Vineyard in B.C.’s Okanagan Valley. Malted barley leaps from the glass along with a vague earthiness and mild fruits. Malty cereal on the palate, with vanilla, hot spices, milk chocolate, and purple grapes. The port-style wine influence is tastefully subtle. Finishes on dark fruits and milk chocolate. (Canada only) $60 CAD",47.0,87,43.0,4.0
2108,Gavin Smith,"The nose is inviting, with marzipan, malt, ripe bananas, milk chocolate, and cinnamon. Green fruit notes emerge later.

Sure to satisfy a sweet tooth.",33.0,87,40.0,1.0
2111,Fred Minnick,"Starting with floral, fruit, and perfume notes, its prominent bouquet barely allows the undertones of honeysuckle, spice, and oak to shine through. On the palate, honey, canned peaches, tobacco, and crème brûlée lead the way just before an explosion of vanilla layers the palate in the form of cake batter, icing, and a white fudge-dipped Oreo. However, bitterness sets in, causing a slight unbalance and lingers toward the medium finish.",75.0,87,47.0,2.0
2112,Fred Minnick,"Slow-roasted corn, marzipan, cinnamon, nutmeg, and kettle corn start this experience and slowly fade to corn on the cob with butter, salt, and pepper.

2113,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Pretty violet and floral notes lead the way, with herb garden and chocolaty oak draped over caramel chews.

A lovely effort that places balance above sheer power.",55.0,87,42.0,3.0
2114,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"An intriguing nose of campfire smoke drapes the distinctive aroma of mesquite charcoal, dark toast with honey, and pretty floral notes.

2120,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Rather than complexity, this all-corn whisky showcases softness and a rich creamy mouthfeel—even if it does meet the Canadian definition of rye whisky. Peppery spices with a keen bite come from the barrel, not grain. Berries and corncobs add depth to fruit cocktail, with sharp spices balancing a lush waxiness. Its syrupy feel evolves into kiwi fruit flavors and tartness on the finish. ($45CAD; Canada only)",35.0,87,40.0,4.0
2122,Fred Minnick,"Initially, floral and fruit meet oak and a cadre of baking spices.

2123,Fred Minnick,"Sweet and smoke open this interesting whiskey that bounces from sweet to savory throughout.

2126,Fred Minnick,"This is unique in that it seems to be malt-forward, specifically floor malt, with oak and cinnamon following. But caramel enters the dance and does so in a big way. Nuances of crème brûlée, caramel popcorn, maple syrup, and caramelized corn with hints of cola, raspberry, and apple tart. While the flavor is here, the finish is just a touch short to put this in elite company. Nonetheless, it’s a decent sipper.",35.0,86,46.0,2.0
2136,Fred Minnick,"Cotton candy, campfire smoke, cinnamon, pilsner beer, butterscotch, and vanilla start a whiskey conversation that’s about balance, easy sipping, and the pursuit of spice. Around mid-palate, a plethora of baking spices—clove, nutmeg, vanilla, cinnamon, and allspice—charms the senses. It’s set up to be a great run, but the approach softens toward the finish with muted brown sugar appearing. Still, the flavor and balance make for a fun sipper and great cocktail mixer.",25.0,86,50.5,2.0
2137,John Hansell,"Drier on the palate than the 90, with more caramel than honey, and more oak spice (especially vanilla) and grip on the finish. Still, rather light in personality. However, I’m looking for more sweet notes to partner with the dried spice. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,86,45.0,2.0
2138,Fred Minnick,"Some bourbons are balanced or complex; this is an all-around versatile pour with initial notes of lightly toasted oak, brown sugar, and butterscotch.

Finally, the quintessential cinnamon shows over a slightly disappointing medium finish.",99.0,86,55.9,2.0
2141,John Hansell,"Distilled in 2001, this year’s release is a departure from recent releases, which were complex and nicely balanced. It’s more aggressive, with tannins and oak dominating, and lacking the body and sweetness to balance it. It’s my least favorite of this year’s offerings. Dark chocolate, toffee, tobacco, and dried fruit round out the palate and offer some comfort. Buffalo Trace Antique Collection 2016",90.0,86,72.05,

2143,Lew Bryson,"Smells like bourbon—corn, a bit of cinnamon, oak—but there’s something else: a touch of doughy sweetness, a note of straight wood, a twist.

2146,Dave Broom,"A light color suggests a relaxed contact between cask and whisky, but what this lacks in terms of ‘woodiness‘ it makes up for in all-round deliciousness. Aberlour is often masked with plenty of sherry and/or bourbon oak; here the distillery character is thrust to the fore and comes out as being highly aromatic. There are candies, bubblegum, kiwi fruits, and cut flowers. The palate is vibrant with a touch of parma violet and pear juice. Altogether a little charmer.",110.0,86,54.3,1.0
2147,Gavin Smith,"This expression of Aberfeldy fits between the core 12 and 21 year old bottlings, but is exclusively available in Travel Retail outlets. The nose opens with a slightly savory note, rich and spicy, with sherry, Jaffa oranges, and sweet oak. The palate is smooth and rounded, with malt, nutty spice, honey, and milky coffee. The finish is lengthy, with Seville oranges, plain chocolate, dark sherry notes, and licorice. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter.",130.0,86,40.0,1.0
2148,John Hansell,"Fresh and clean, with notes of vanilla, ripe barley, honey, caramel apple, and toasted coconut. Creamy and mouth-coating in texture, leading to a pleasingly dry, spicy oak finish. Very drinkable, yet satisfying. Quite nice.",80.0,86,50.5,1.0
2149,John Hansell,"Stylish, sophisticated. Fresh, honeyed floral, green grapes, kiwi, plum, and currant jelly. Hint of cinnamon and nutmeg. Soft, gently sweet finish. Pleasing sweetness to go with the fruit.",80.0,86,50.0,1.0
2150,Gavin Smith,"This expression from the Isle of Arran distillery appeared in 2010 and one-third of the component whiskies were matured in European oak casks while two-thirds came from American oak. Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose, with peaches, brandy, and ginger snaps, plus vanilla and mild oak. Smooth and creamy on the palate, with spicy summer fruits, apricots, and hazelnuts. The lingering finish is spicy, biscuity, and slowly drying, with just a hint of salt.",70.0,86,46.0,
2151,Gavin Smith,"This single sherry cask bottling from Arran was distilled on February 17th, 1997, being bottled on February 5th, 2014. The nose opens with a hint of malt vinegar, followed by sherry and sultanas. More floral with time. Full-bodied, with spicy sherry, figs, and raisins. Long and spicy in the finish, with fruity sherry to the end. (U.S. only)",125.0,86,53.2,1.0
2152,Gavin Smith,"Illicit Stills is the first in a trilogy of limited releases reflecting Arran’s distilling heritage. It includes unpeated Arran spirit, some of which has been aged in port pipes, along with amounts of medium-peated and heavily-peated whisky. Warm and rounded on the oily nose; figs and peat, before caramel and vanilla develop. Viscous in the mouth, with succulent orange and spicy peat. The finish is very long and peppery, with mouth-drying tannins. £85",123.0,86,56.4,1.0
2153,John Hansell,"It always amazes me how well this triple-distilled Lowland whisky ages. The best ones are in their twenties and thirties. This one, at 40, is still holding up quite well, all things considered. Lively, fragrant aroma for such an old whisky. Notes of vanilla, coconut cream pie, butterscotch, hay, wood shavings, sultana, dried citrus, and a potpourri of spice. Some “old oak” notes emerging from time to time throughout, with a gently spicy finish. An expensive whisky, but those who pony up the money will enjoy it.",,86,41.6,1.0
2154,John Hansell,"When compared to its younger siblings, this whisky is deeper in flavor. The citrus becomes more dominant (glazed orange, tangerine marmalade), with added notes of caramelized nuts and maple syrup. A good dash of dried spices kicks in and the whisky becomes firm and dry on the finish. My favorite of the standard range is still the 21 year old expression, which has been around for quite some time.",95.0,86,43.0,1.0
2155,Gavin Smith,"Auchentoshan has launched a range of travel retail-exclusive bottlings with names relating to oak, including Heartwood, which is matured in a mix of deeply-charred former bourbon and toasted oloroso sherry casks. Soft, medium sherry notes on the nose; stem ginger, cinnamon, parma violets, and clove-studded oranges. The palate features wood polish, old leather, plain chocolate, cloves, and ginger. Dates and spicy orange marmalade on the lengthy finish. €50",63.0,86,43.0,1.0
2156,Gavin Smith,"This expression of Auchentoshan from Douglas Laing’s Provenance range was distilled in September 2000, matured in bourbon casks, and bottled in November 2012. Opens very sweet on the nose, with vanilla, peaches, and apricots, plus allspice. More caramel in time. Medium bodied, with sweet fruits, new-mown hay, and hard toffee on the palate, giving way to spice and aniseed. The spicy finish features cloves, and dries steadily, with a final flourish of pepper. £40",62.0,86,46.0,1.0
2157,Gavin Smith,"The latest single cask expression of Auchentoshan from Wemyss Malts is 14 years old and was matured in a bourbon barrel. The outturn is 342 bottles. The nose is fleetingly herbal; then offers crème de citron, turning to tinned peaches in syrup, and finally pine and peppery caramel. Silky-smooth in the mouth, spicy, with lemon and digestive biscuits. Freshly-squeezed lemon lingers in the chili and chocolaty finish. £78",70.0,86,46.0,
2158,Gavin Smith,"Wemyss Malts has bottled several single cask Auchentoshans in the past, and this 15 year old release is of 342 bottles, provided by a bourbon barrel. Peaches, caramel, sea salt, and developing lemonade on the nose. Sweet and fruity on the palate, with more peaches and very soft background spices. The finish dries slowly, with ginger and a hint of aniseed. £75",126.0,86,46.0,1.0
2159,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in October 1997 and aged in a single refill hogshead, 360 bottles were released in 2014 as part of Langside’s Distiller’s Art range. The nose is mildly herbal, with green wood, heather, and developing soft toffee notes. Soft and gently spiced on the palate, with hazelnuts, and peaches in cream. The finish is relatively long, with milk chocolate, and tingling sweet spices. £62",97.0,86,48.0,1.0
2160,Gavin Smith,"This cask strength Northern Highlander offers a full and complex nose, comprising brandy notes, stewed apricots, spices, table salt, and white pepper. A hint of nougat turns to darker caramel. Rich on the palate, mouth-coating, sweet, with lively spices. The finish is buttery, with a pinch of ginger, and a final brandy-and-soda finish.",120.0,86,53.9,1.0
2161,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in October 1991, this 20 year old Private Collection expression of Balblair spent 40 months of secondary maturation in casks sourced from Crozes-Hermitage, the largest AOC in the northern Rhône wine-producing region of France. The nose offers red currants, sultanas, vanilla, and white pepper. The palate is initially soft and sweet, with summer fruits, but gradually darkens and dries. The finish features dark chocolate and raisins. 2,000 bottles.",140.0,86,45.0,1.0
2162,John Hansell,"Gold color (as its name suggests) with a hint of copper. This whisky, which was finished in Caribbean rum casks, follows on the heels of the limited edition The Balvenie 17 year old Rum Cask. The 17 year old was pleasant enough, but quite sweet (I rated it an 80). This new Golden Cask is an improvement, because the higher alcohol level, along with an array of dried spice, helps to balance the sweet rum notes. Lively, bright tangerine, nectarine, and pineapple combine with Balvenie’s signature honey, nougat, Heath bar, light molasses, and milk chocolate. Dried spice (vanilla, cinnamon, nutmeg) and gritty oak resin kick in on the finish, rounding everything out quite nicely. Now if we could only have the best of both worlds -- the balance of the Golden Cask 14 year old, and the maturity of the 17 year old. That could be a whisky worthy of a 90s rating. (Travel Retail Exclusive) Price per liter.",62.0,86,47.5,
2163,Dave Broom,"A limited edition bottling to commemorate the great David Stewart’s 50th year in the business and, as befits this quiet man, here’s a release that rewards just sitting and listening. This gives more of a nod to Cognac than Speyside; something to do with the dried apricot, orange blossom, and golden syrup. The palate is gentle and layered, with more dried fruits, which are balanced by an almost jammy finish where, finally, some cereal is glimpsed.",130.0,86,43.0,1.0
2164,Gavin Smith,"This expression was aged in a European oak oloroso sherry butt. A savory opening to the nose, followed by figs dipped in lemon juice. Sweet, spicy cream sherry on the palate, Christmas cake flavors, then black pepper and tannins develop. The finish is medium to long, with honey and malt. Accomplished, but expensive for its age.",,86,58.2,1.0
2165,John Hansell,"Antique gold. Aromas of toffee, malty sweetness, fresh mint and subtle oak. Mouth coating, creamy texture-almost chewy-with flavors of toffee, almonds, dark chocolate, and subtle wood spices on the finish. This is a very pleasing, straightforward whisky that is quite mature for its age.",40.0,86,46.0,1.0
2166,John Hansell,"Finished in a tawny port cask. Peat smoke and seaweed interwoven with layers of ripe, red fruit (currant, raspberry, cherry), crisp citrus, graham cracker, vanilla, and honey. Nice interplay between sweetness, fruit, and smoke. (Brighter and more dimensional than the other two reviewed here.)",85.0,86,46.0,1.0
2167,John Hansell,"Benriach is a lesser-known whisky and, for a Speysider, fairly light in style. This one is very bright and fruity on the nose with aromas of citrus (lemon), pineapple, green grapes, vanilla bean, honey, and linseed oil. Its age is evident, but tucked away in the background. The palate mirrors the aromas and is quite complex. As you might expect for a 34 year old whisky, it dries out mid-palate with some grassy hay notes yielding to resinous oak towards the finish, but the oak never becomes excessive. I can’t remember the last time I tasted a Benriach this good.",140.0,86,48.0,1.0
2168,John Hansell,"A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold, but they're equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (A Binny's Beverage Depot exclusive.)",54.0,86,59.5,1.0
2169,Dave Broom,"This is a new bottler to me and they’ve made quite an arrival with this, a classic Benrinnes. This is a distillery where meatiness is desirable, and this is as thick and savory as a slow-cooked pheasant stew or cassoulet, with an added herbal and pruney element. A real sweetness and a pleasing lift of sulfur (which can enhance whiskies) add to the complexity. Chewy on the tongue, with earthiness revealed by water. £65",101.0,86,57.8,1.0
2170,Gavin Smith,"This most recent Connoisseurs’ Choice bottling from Scotland’s southernmost distillery has been matured in refill sherry hogsheads. The nose is pleasing and light, mildly herbal, with cut grass, citrus fruits, and a hint of malt. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity in the mouth, with peaches, nuts, and discreet spice. Relatively lengthy in the creamy finish. Very drinkable and quite substantial.",70.0,86,43.0,1.0
2171,Gavin Smith,"One of the first releases from the recently formed Hunter Laing & Co, established in Glasgow by Stewart Laing, is this 20 year
old expression of Bladnoch. It was distilled in November 1992 and matured in a refill sherry cask. Lemon cake, honey, and ginger nuts on the pleasing nose; fruity and spicy on the palate, with a savory flourish, and a honey and malt backdrop. Spicy caramel and mocha coffee in the finish. £75",115.0,86,50.0,1.0
2172,Gavin Smith,"Samsara is a combination of 8 to 10 year old whiskies matured in first-fill bourbon barrels and California red wine hogsheads, bottled non-chill filtered. Initially slightly savory on the nose, then peaches and cream, and soft spices. The palate is supple and sweet, with vanilla, mango, and passion fruit. The finish is long, with spicy pears. Drier spices emerge and ultimately, light tannins. The red wine influence is greatly enhanced by the addition of a few drops of water. £60",75.0,86,46.7,1.0
2173,Gavin Smith,"This single cask bottling was distilled in February 1993 and matured for 20 years in a sherry butt. Rich and spicy on the nose: peel, dates, and sultanas. More floral in time. A silky mouthfeel, major spice notes, ginger, and sweet sherry. Long in the finish, with nutmeg and plain chocolate cherry liqueur.£80",129.0,86,51.5,1.0
2174,Dave Broom,"Tempest to the world, Dorus Mor in the U.S., this has an intensely salty start that’s
like being slapped by a wave on Bowmore’s harbor wall. That marine note
continues: samphire, clams with a squeeze of lemon. Water brings out wet clay.
The palate is equally briny, but with a sprig of lavender, then soft fruits
wreathed in peat smoke. It’s tense and coiled, with real energy when neat, but
it’s best like that, so deal with the heat.",119.0,86,55.1,1.0
2175,Dave Broom,"The ruby color gives the port maturation away, as does the nose: all plum crumble, stewed rhubarb, and caramelized orchard fruits. It’s more autumnal than jammy with hints of dusty angelica and only vestigial smoke. The palate is hot, with those hedgerow fruits and a light touch of perfumed lavender before a flock of tarry smoke appears on the finish. All well-integrated and at its best with a little water.",630.0,86,50.8,1.0
2176,Dave Broom,"This was a true double maturation: a dozen years in first-fill bourbon and then 13 years in claret. In its 20s, Bowmore tends to shed its smoke and allows the soft fruits (here, persimmon, nectarine) which have always been there to show themselves. There’s a light oiliness on the tongue. The casks have added vanilla, red fruits, and spice, but the overall impression is of harmony and integration. Lovely. (200 bottles) £350",455.0,86,55.7,1.0
2177,John Hansell,"Less appetizing brine and zing, and showing more “weight” when compared to its sibling. Sweeter notes of toffee, fig, and vanilla fudge lay the foundation for mixed nuts, black raspberry, plum, nectarine, and ripe red grape. A soothing dram.",100.0,86,46.0,1.0
2178,John Hansell,"A distinctive (and intriguing) Bruichladdich, with honeyed malt, vanilla pod, charcoal, exotic fruit, and dark chocolate bourbon balls, teased with suggestions of fennel and espresso bean. Tactile, leather finish. (A D&M Wines & Liquors exclusive.)",130.0,86,51.4,1.0
2179,Dave Broom,"This has good breadth and hints of honey-nut cornflakes on the nose, with the distillery’s sweet, lemon-fresh/floral core still evident, but skewed more toward roasted notes, like toasted rice and sun-dried grasses; even a hint of the felt-festooned interior of a woolen mill. Water brings out meadowsweet. Raspberries lead on the palate, contrasting with the crisp, nutty chaff notes. It’s citric and gingery on the finish, but has drive and energy. £42",68.0,86,50.0,1.0
2180,Dave Broom,"The nose is slightly closed, all very delicate, with some hay-like aromas akin to harvest time. This gentleness allows sweet melon-like fruits to come through, alongside patisserie, icing, gentle vanilla, and an effect like Hedione, the ‘smell’ of sunshine. Rounded and very sweet, typical of the distillery, with a lightly drying effect similar to powdered icing sugar. It slightly loses it with water, so keep neat. A pleasant, straight down the middle Laddie. £60/500 ml",100.0,86,53.8,1.0
2181,Dave Broom,"The official Fèis Ìle  2016 bottling. This is a mix of bourbon and wine casks given a period in virgin oak. The finish initially adds a certain sauna-like element, but then the distillery’s lemon drops and flowers come through, alongside baked apples, coconut, and a touch of smoke. The alcohol burn is negligible, allowing more estery elements, melon, and red fruits to come through. A classic Laddie, in other words. (1881 bottles) £95",123.0,86,50.0,
2182,Dave Broom,"Matured in cognac before being finished in Sauternes; here we have a clean, sweet, and well-rounded Bunna’, with hickory-like smoke, bonfire, and ginger biscuits. Lightly vegetal notes with farmyard elements among the smoke and thick, citric sweetness. Immediate smoke on top of this mix of spice, Seville orange, apricot, cheesecake base, hazelnut, red fruits, and preserved ginger in syrup adding an almost peppery finish. Lovely. £250",421.0,86,52.9,1.0
2183,Gavin Smith,"This expression includes young, heavily-peated Bunnahabhain matured in bourbon barrels, mixed with 20 to 21 year old spirit aged in sherry butts. Fragrant, peppery peat on the early nose, brine and fabric Band-Aids. Ultimately, leathery orange. Smooth and supple on the palate, with intense, smoky fresh fruit giving way to quite dry spices. The relatively long finish yields drying peat, plain chocolate, and developing licorice. £80",100.0,86,50.0,1.0
2184,Dave Broom,"This is Caol Ila not only in unpeated guise, but from a ‘bodega-treated’ sherry butt. Full and lush, the distillery’s pear and melon here are in super-ripe guise alongside sweet biscuits, mashed banana, and Mars bar. With water, it’s more a cabinetmaker’s workshop—but isn’t woody. The mouth is sweet and concentrated with jabs of raspberry and hedgerow fruits. Who needs peat? My best value bottling this issue.",103.0,86,59.3,1.0
2185,Gavin Smith,"Unpeated Caol Ilas have become a regular in the Special Releases portfolio and this expression from 2000 is the eleventh to appear. The early nose is reticent and faintly floral, with freshly sliced green apples. Sharp and sweet on the palate, with malt and citrus fruit, and even a hint of mint. Ginger, mixed nuts, aniseed, and more mint in the medium-length finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016 bottling.",140.0,86,61.5,1.0
2186,Dave Broom,"When this first appeared I found it too sweet, which was strange, as the finishing period is in dry oloroso casks. This most recent iteration sees the finish better integrated. There’s more spiciness than on the standard 14 year old, while the fruit seems plumper: more apricot and kumquat. The waxiness is there but the candle is scented. It still clings to the tongue, but there is an added nutty, oxidized character. A marked improvement.£47",74.0,86,43.0,1.0
2187,Gavin Smith,"Duncan Taylor’s latest cask strength, single cask release from the Sutherland distillery of Clynelish is 21 years old. It is sweet on the nose, with hand-rolling tobacco, milk chocolate, overripe grapes, and vanilla. Becoming saltier and drier. Nutty and mildly maritime on the palate, with lots of spice, steadily drying. Spice and ginger in the lengthy, oily finish. £80",125.0,86,53.2,1.0
2188,Gavin Smith,"The latest Wemyss Malts single cask offering from Clynelish distillery is a 16 year old expression, matured in a hogshead which gave an out-turn of 339 bottles. The nose offers sea salt and lemon, with emerging green apples and vanilla. Apple tart with custard and a dusting of cinnamon on the palate. The finish is long and peppery, with a hint of freshly-ground coffee beans. £75",126.0,86,46.0,1.0
2189,Gavin Smith,"With the percentage of former oloroso sherry-matured spirit ramped up to 60 percent in this Dee variant, the nose is deeper and richer than that of the Tweed Dram; Seville orange marmalade and a hint of cocoa.

The finish is lengthy, with plums, black coffee, and a suggestion of licorice. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",69.0,86,40.0,1.0
2190,Gavin Smith,"Comprising 80 percent American white oak-matured whisky and 20 percent from ex-oloroso sherry casks, the Tweed Dram offers lots of citrus fruit on the nose, with an early dusting of icing sugar, then orange and lemon wine gums. Relatively light and fresh, with gentle fudge notes. Malt, toffee, cinnamon, and over-ripe oranges on the spicy palate. Quite long in the finish, with spicy oak, nutmeg, and lingering dark chocolate notes. £42 Currently not available in the U.S.",69.0,86,40.0,1.0
2191,Gavin Smith,"The most youthful bottling in the Constellation series is a 19 year old, which started life in a first-fill bourbon barrel before being transferred into a European oak port pipe in 2002 for a further nine years of maturation. The nose offers a hint of new leather, marzipan, developing caramel, and damsons. Zesty fruit, allspice, and ground ginger on the palate, along with thick-cut orange marmalade. The finish is long, warming, and spicy. Cask number 18; 737 bottles.",,86,53.8,1.0
2192,Dave Broom,"Along with Cragganmore, this is one of the underrated members of the original Classic Six. Quite why has always slightly baffled me. OK, it isn’t smoky, but the nose has a deep, soft, honeyed sweetness: think caramelized fruits, hints of thick cream, and a light touch of fennel and sharp citrus. Thick in the center and very gentle, it’s that chunkiness in the middle that is the secret to its beauty.",65.0,86,43.0,1.0
2193,Gavin Smith,"There have been three previous Special Release offerings of Dalwhinnie, and this 1987 distillation is the first to have been aged in rejuvenated American oak hogsheads. Cloves are to the fore on the aromatic nose, along with cinnamon, ginger, fudge, and tropical fruits. Initially oily and honeyed on the palate, with developing spice, wood resin, and herbal flavors. Spicy oak in the lengthy finish, with a return to the initial note of cloves. 5,358 bottles.",300.0,86,52.1,1.0

2196,John Hansell,"The fifth peated release of Edradour. This one is aged in Marsala casks. Sweet, with clinging fruit and thumping raw smoke. Youthful, embracing, and fleshy in the middle, with ash, anise, and espresso that grow toward the finish. These Ballechin releases keep getting better. Reminds me of a young Islay whisky without the brine and seaweed.",105.0,86,,1.0

2198,Gavin Smith,"This 15 year old has been fully matured in bourbon casks. Relatively reticent on the nose, with light vanilla. Becoming more aromatic and spicy, with tinned apricots in syrup. Medium-bodied, relatively dry, with ginger, oak, and cloves, before a touch of milk chocolate appears. The chocolate darkens. Aniseed and perpetual spice.",85.0,86,46.0,1.0
2199,Gavin Smith,"Clearly sharing the same DNA as the 10 year old expression, this variant has less overt pear drops on the nose, which is altogether more floral and complex, with ripe oranges, pineapple, and an herbal note. Elegant on the palate, with orange, vanilla; and contrasting dark berries, black pepper, and oak. The finish is lengthy and slightly oily. £57",92.0,86,46.0,1.0
2200,Gavin Smith,"New in 2016, this is an NAS entry-level bottling for the brand, matured in bourbon barrels before spending a finishing period in oloroso sherry butts.

The finish is medium in length, with milky coffee and soft spices.",42.0,86,40.0,1.0
2201,John Hansell,"Nicely sherried. Rich, with maple syrup, honey-drenched citrus, sultana, and a good dried oak spice finish for balance. Well done for a 12 year old, and definite competition for Macallan of the same age.",59.0,86,46.0,1.0
2202,Dominic Roskrow,"The variety between this series of single casks is quite extraordinary. This has a soft and light nose with some mint and liqueured fruit, and a big, rich, and impressive taste with anise and menthol, glacé cherries, and traces of mint. The finish is warming and full, with the mint and cherry theme carrying through to a slightly peppery conclusion. £71",110.0,86,51.7,
2203,Gavin Smith,"The first peated GlenDronach release, matured in bourbon barrels before a period in oloroso and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks. The nose offers dry, earthy peat, then becomes quite perfumed, with vanilla and lime. Light to medium-bodied, with sweeter peat notes on the palate. Creamy, with honey, cinnamon sticks, and green apples. The finish is medium in length, with peat slowly fading and a flaring of spices near the close.",48.0,86,46.0,
2204,Dave Broom,"I always think that having “dull” in the middle of its name doesn’t do this distillery any favors. This is anything but; instead this is a fresh and vibrant example that brings on a Whitmanesque reverie of chewing on leaves of grass: sappy, fresh chlorophyll, coumarin, lime. These scented grasses—now vetiver—remain in charge on the tongue. A rolling prairie in the mouth, and best neat.",100.0,86,57.4,1.0
2205,Dave Broom,"A sherry butt this time, which has allowed the whisky a little more space to breathe. Although as concentrated as you'd expect here, we can see more fragrance emerging and a big-boned elegance is on show — think Margaret Dumont. I pick up some rose hip syrup, dried apple, Armagnac/prune, and a licorice note, as seen on the ’62; while on the palate, a good balance of rich chocolatey sweetness to offset the tannins. Big but balanced. £512",803.0,86,48.5,
2206,Dave Broom,"The color is light gold, the nose is very sweet and delicate, with a floral aspect that’s not always immediately apparent in Glenfarclas. This is from a fourth-fill hogshead, which provides creaminess, toffee, a little hint of orchid, burnt cream, and grilled peach. Sweetly delicious. The palate is akin to bread-and-butter pudding, with that creaminess continuing. All very summery and ‘up.’ Quite different, but appealing. £350",589.0,86,41.3,1.0
2207,Dave Broom,"Delicate, with some jasmine, lily of the valley, and even, with time, the rich aldehydes of Chanel No.5. This heaviness gives a butterscotch-like quality when water’s added, alongside apple. The palate is thicker than the light color suggests—it’s from a fourth-fill hogshead—with overripe pear and white chocolate; with water, becomes scented with an added touch of marzipan and chestnut puree. One for a thoughtful afternoon’s contemplation. £760",1279.0,86,47.0,1.0
2208,Dave Broom,"The world’s best-selling single malt. Isn’t that sufficient to give this dram some respect? It might be me, but it strikes me that ’Fiddich has more heft to it these days, with a sherried element giving the pear, apple, and light cereal of the distillery character a sweet, plump, sultana underpinning. This then adds chewiness to the palate, balancing the dry nuttiness and receding on the finish where those green fruits come through to add fresh acidity. Great balance.",37.0,86,40.0,1.0
2209,Dave Broom,"Here, a new solera vat is home to a Glenfiddich that has been exclusively aged in sherry casks, and shows its origins with deep, black fruitiness, orange peel, and sultana. The signature pears of ’Fiddich

2210,Dave Broom,"Another from Glenfiddich’s three new solera vats, here we can see the distillery’s light character turned up to the max thanks to a mix of American oak, red wine casks, and a smidgen of sherry.

2211,Dave Broom,"Pale straw in color, and while it is clean and fresh, it’s also very delicate, with elderflower blossom, dusty florals, and a freshly-starched linen note. All rather discreet, shy even, but effort reveals a subtly lovely dram. Water adds a perfumed, green note. As the nose suggests, it’s not an immediate thruster of a malt, with some light jasmine tea and a little fleshy fruit on the end. Tread cautiously, lest you scare it.",500.0,86,43.1,
2212,Dave Broom,"I used to find this a little lacking in structure. Either I’ve changed my palate (or was always wrong), or the solera’s slow changes have added depth and complexity. The nose is all cooked plums, with some blueberry, stewing rhubarb. All is delicately scented, with some currant leaf, then sultana and sweet dried fruits. The palate is equally fruity—more hedgerow fruits now—but there’s grip and a little fresh acidity to balance. Hugely appealing and approachable.",55.0,86,40.0,1.0
2213,Gavin Smith,"Melon notes to the fore early on the nose; floral, especially carnations. Progressively more caramel, with Parma violet sweets. Pretty and feminine. Richer and fuller-bodied on the palate than the nose might suggest. Fresh fruit, apple juice, almonds, and gentle spices, slowly moving to milky coffee in the finish. The faintest hint of smoke pervades the flavor, but is very much a ‘bit part’ player in the ensemble.",125.0,86,51.1,1.0
2214,Gavin Smith,"This is the first expression from Glen Garioch to have been fully matured in wine casks, specifically tonneaux de vin rouge barriques from Saint-Julien in Bordeaux. The whisky was distilled on June 23rd, 1998, and spent over 15 years in the Bordeaux wood. Milk chocolate-coated caramels, crystallized ginger, and cranberries on the nose. Autumn berries on the early palate, turning to cough syrup, with rich malt and lively chocolate spiciness. Caramel merges with white pepper in the relatively long finish.",170.0,86,48.0,1.0
2215,John Hansell,"The ruby/antique amber color suggests a first-fill sherry cask; the nose and palate confirm it. This whisky is a mouthful: fruitcake, roasted chestnuts, burnt raisin, candied orange, molasses, leather, tobacco, dark chocolate, wax, and a hint of clove. An incredible amount of sherry, but it’s not cloying. The flavors are clean, complex, and well-balanced.",175.0,86,55.3,1.0
2216,John Hansell,"An intriguing whisky. Blueberry cobbler, crushed grape, maple syrup, nougat, and spice (cinnamon, nutmeg). The oak is polished and unimposing. Liqueur-ish. A nice contrast to its younger sibling, and it’s more polarizing because of its distinctiveness.",694.0,86,43.0,1.0
2217,Gavin Smith,"Glenglassaugh distillery has released a number of country-exclusive expressions recently, including this 37 year old single cask (470 bottles) for North America, under the Master Distillers Selection banner. Initially, cornflakes and sherry on the nose, with developing vanilla and soft toffee. Becoming very sweet. Rich and notably spicy on the palate, with dates and dark chocolate. Persistently spicy in the finish, with background citrus fruits.",625.0,86,56.0,1.0
2218,John Hansell,"A new, cask-strength Glengoyne without chill-filtering. Both features put this whisky in a higher class than the entry level 10 year old. That classic clean maltiness which Glengoyne is known for is certainly in this whisky. With the addition of some water, the whisky really opens up, becoming fragrant, fruity (cherry pits, apples), along with hints of anise and almonds. A nice effort from the new owners.",50.0,86,57.2,1.0
2219,Gavin Smith,"Distiller’s Gold is exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and is dedicated to the distillery’s first manager, Cochran Cartwright, whose ghost is said to haunt the Stirlingshire distillery. Distiller’s Gold displays a nose of brittle nut toffee and dried fruit, with vanilla and caramel notes emerging. Spicy tropical fruits on the palate, with an edge of cinnamon and ginger. Medium in length, pleasantly oaky, persistently nutty and spicy. Price is per liter.",70.0,86,40.0,1.0
2220,Gavin Smith,"Glengoyne’s core range has been revamped: the 12 year old cask strength bottling was replaced by one with no age statement, and this 15 year old was added. Maturation has taken place in sherry casks and the result is a nose of vanilla, ginger, toffee, vintage cars’ leather seats, and sweet fruit notes. The somewhat oily palate features quite lively spices, raisins, hazelnuts, and oak. The finish is medium in length and spicy to the end, with cocoa powder. £48",75.0,86,43.0,1.0
2221,Gavin Smith,"The third Special Releases cask strength Glenkinchie is the oldest to date and the first to have been matured in European oak casks. Peach and pear soufflé on the initial nose, followed by apricots and toffee. The palate is rich and smooth, with dark fruits, walnuts, nutmeg, and a hint of resin. Quite lengthy, with ginger and white pepper in the aromatic and subtly drying finish. Diageo Special Releases 2016. (5,928 bottles)",450.0,86,57.5,1.0
2222,John Hansell,"Amber gold color. Rather sweet aroma and flavors of caramel, light toffee, almonds, and vanilla. A background note of fruit (lemon? ripe cherries?) contributes to its complexity.

2223,John Hansell,"Well-rounded and pleasingly sweet, with ripe red strawberries, raspberry, tropical fruit, graham cracker, white chocolate, and anise, all on a bed of toffee.

Soothing finish, with a gentle sweetness balanced by a soft, leathery dryness.",135.0,86,40.5,1.0
2227,Dave Broom,"This hails from the first of Rothes’ stock that was specifically laid down for the vintage release program. The nose shows typical Rothes softness — woolen blankets and malted milk. As it opens. there’s wet linen, caramel fudge, and a hint of mixed berry and dark fruits slowly collapsing into jam. A touch of sherried nuttiness on the palate is followed by thick clover honey and a little crisp malt. The finish is gentle, lightly spiced with a touch of struck match sulfur.",80.0,86,43.0,1.0
2228,Dave Broom,"Last year, four whisky editors were invited by Glenrothes’ heritage director Ronnie Cox to choose a single cask bottling. Being opinionated hacks, they couldn’t agree and so two casks were chosen! This, the oldest, from a refill butt, is for the European markets, and shows hints of rancio: truffle, leaf mold, boot polish, and star anise. The impression is of faded elegance with tannins, fruit, and spice in harmony, and a hint of pomegranate-like bitterness just on the end. £600",956.0,86,52.1,1.0
2229,Dave Broom,"A very immediate, expressive, sweet start, with manuka honey dribbling on top of baked fruits, sweet citrus, and a dollop of clotted cream on the side. All very luscious and calorific. As if this dessert theme wasn’t sufficient, the palate lays it on even more thickly, with apricot now joining the mass of fruits. The light grip adds very necessary structure and stops things getting floppy. One for those with a sweet tooth. Recommended.(U.S. only)",140.0,86,52.3,
2230,Dave Broom,"Lightly grassy and hay-like, with some wheat chaff. The nose is quite hot, but that cereal note (reminiscent of draff) is pleasing, sitting alongside clean apple and orange barley water. The palate is sweeter and more floral (pear blossom) compared to the nose, though retaining some nuttiness. Has good verve. When diluted, the finish shows real chocolate and some dry spice. A very interesting young ‘un. £54",84.0,86,54.8,1.0
2231,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A rare bottling from a distillery that is more commonly released as a part of whisky blends. Light fruit and sweet malt define the nose, with apple, apricot, and honey. The entry is bursting with flavor, centered around malt, along with honey, salt, and apricot. The mid-palate adds a touch of oak, smoke, and spice, and is extremely well integrated and balanced. A medium-length finish ends abruptly and a little too dry, the only left turn in an otherwise superb whisky. (Julio’s Liquors only)",60.0,86,46.0,1.0
2232,Gavin Smith,"Recently added to Chivas Brothers’ lineup of Cask Strength Edition whiskies, this Eastern Highland single malt from the ‘lost’ distillery of Glenugie in the fishing port of Peterhead is perfumed on the nose, with discreet sherry, cocoa, fresh leather, blackcurrants, peaches, and apricots. The palate is initially sweet, with fresh fruit, but old-fashioned cough drops and black coffee notes soon arrive. Very long in the spicy, tannic oak finish.

Soon starts to dry…drying steadily through the nutty finish, with musty oak and aniseed. £430",653.0,86,46.0,1.0
2234,John Hansell,"Dark and complex. Sweet notes of toffee and caramel are spiced with notes of cinnamon and cocoa.

2235,John Hansell,"A lush Highland Park, aged in a sherry cask. Ripe fruit (sultana, apricot, dark cherry pits), layers of sweetness (toffee, nougat, molasses) almonds, and juicy oak. Hints of vanilla cream, honey, heather and polished leather add dimension. This sherry contribution is clean, not overly sappy or waxy like others I have tasted. (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)",180.0,86,45.3,1.0
2236,Gavin Smith,"Harald Fairhair was King of Norway and a major figure in Viking history. This Warrior variant takes us closer to Highland Park’s traditional DNA, with the nose offering potato peels on a barbecue; earthy and herbal, with developing notes of heather in bloom and even violets. Lively fresh fruits, newly-baked cake, nutmeg, and ginger figure on the palate. The spicy finish is relatively long, with candied citrus peel and licorice. €75/700 ml",96.0,86,40.0,1.0

Icing sugar, vanilla, milk chocolate, apricots, plus mildly smoky malt on the nose. Full-bodied and fruity on the palate, with toffee, black pepper, and a hint of peat in the background. The medium-length finish is slowly drying. £45",69.0,86,46.0,1.0
2238,Gavin Smith,"Heather honey, malt, newly-cut hay, pineapple, and very slight smoke on the nose. Leather, malt, cinnamon, a touch of oak and soft smokiness on the palate. Medium in length, with a hint of honey behind the oak, spice, and smoke. (Travel Retail exclusive.) €150",202.0,86,43.0,1.0
2239,Gavin Smith,"Freya is the third release in Highland Park’s Valhalla Collection; unusually, it has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. It fits into the core range between the 12 and 18 year olds. The nose is sweet, floral, and heathery, with pineapple, mango, and a background earthiness. Finally, vanilla and milk chocolate. Smooth on the palate, with passion fruit, and more overt peatiness than is apparent on the nose. Subtle peat, char, and a hint of licorice in the finish.",235.0,86,51.2,1.0
2240,John Hansell,"A coastal Speysider, and this is evident in many of the Inchgower bottlings, including this one. This is quite a fruity dram, with notes of tangerine, lemon, and kiwi. Soft vanilla, coconut, and honey play in the mix, with a lingering salty/seaweed tang on the palate for intrigue. Very clean, light, and surprisingly reserved in oak notes, considering its age.",140.0,86,49.9,1.0
2241,John Hansell,"Technically a Speyside whisky, but it tastes more like a coastal Northern Highlander. The foundation of this whisky is a lovely honeyed maltiness. It is aged in a sherry cask, which provides layers of rich toffee, caramel, and orange marmalade. Brisk sea salt notes emerge on the palate keeping the whisky fresh and quite lively-the coastal influence-while deft seaweed and spice add complexity.",70.0,86,46.0,1.0
2242,John Hansell,"Antique gold. Gentle aromas of oak, caramel, and a hint of vanilla and sea breeze. Light-medium body, with a creamy texture. Soft, gentle flavors of vanilla, toffee, subtle fruit and brine, with a dryish oaky finish.",48.0,86,43.0,
2243,John Hansell,"Amber gold color. Medium bodied and slightly oily. Peaty bonfire aroma and flavors, complemented by a creamy caramel maltiness. Subtle notes of brine, seaweed, and a hint of pear fruit spice things up a bit. Gently dry, moderately smoky finish, with teasing sea salt notes. I have always wondered what a peat smoke infused Isle of Jura whisky would taste like. I was also concerned that too much peat smoke could dominate this whisky's flavor profile. Fortunately, this hasn't happened. The peat smoke is certainly evident, but the Jura character comes through too. One extra bonus: it's bottled at 45%, which kicks the flavors up a notch.",35.0,86,45.0,
2244,Dave Broom,"Though as pale as ever, this Lagavulin is hardly in need of a Charles Atlas course. The nose is ozonic, like rock pools at low tide with kelp splattered around. Sweetness comes in the form of cloudy apple juice and a smokehouse kipperiness. The palate is explosive, with masses of retronasal action showing violet root, thyme, juniper, tarragon/fennel, and a finish akin to smoked cheese. An improvement on the 2012 release.",119.0,86,55.1,1.0
2245,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Extreme peat smoke explodes out of the glass. It’s diesely, burnt tire smoke more than campfire. Past the peat, there's salt, paste, and honey. On the palate it's another blast of smoke. This nearly chokingly strong smoke dissipates slightly to reveal oyster shells, malt, paste, and honey. Make no mistake, the smoke is the star and will remind you of that fact hours after you finish your last sip. An uber-peated whisky that hardcore peatheads will surely adore. (U.S. only)",130.0,86,54.2,1.0
2246,Dave Broom,"Another NAS Laphroaig made from a blend of different cask types. The nose is dry and lightly tarry—a note that continues to the dried glass. There are medicinal phenols, a biscuity note, then an aroma of fuel, like being on a trawler deck. The palate shows integration between the oaks, lending a smokehouse aroma. Water lightens, but you still get that smoky smear of phenol at the end that tells you this is Laphroaig. Like it.",125.0,86,48.0,1.0
2247,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A non-chill filtered, cask strength single malt from Littlemill, vintage 1991. Littlemill’s sweet nose is inviting, with butter toffee, milk chocolate, dried apricot, and straw. On the palate, these notes are joined by a nice maltiness as well as a touch of salt. In the mid-palate we get a touch of spice (black pepper and cinnamon) and some citrus. The finish is medium-length and slightly acidic, a departure for an otherwise affable cask strength whisky. (Park Avenue Liquor only)",160.0,86,49.2,1.0
2248,John Hansell,"I’ve known Loch Lomond has been making some peated expressions, and it’s nice to finally see (and taste) some product being bottled with this whisky and its sibling Croftengea, reviewed below. This is my choice of the two, with greater (and more richly textured) flavors to accompany the peat. The smoke is balanced (and tamed) nicely by sweet notes of creamy vanilla, honey, gristy malt, hay, and subtle fruit and spice. The finish remains balanced and lingers with a smoky, lightly salty tang. Fresh and youthful, yet still nicely matured at 13 years old, and a nice alternative to smoky Islay whiskies.",70.0,86,45.0,1.0
2249,John Hansell,"A big and sappy Longmorn, with notes of chewy toffee, juicy oak, candied fruit, sandalwood, citrus and even some distant smoke. The standard distillery issue of Longmorn 15 year old itself is a big whisky-one of the biggest in Speyside with its rich, malty foundation-but this expression kicks it up a notch. Aging 31 years in a sherry butt injects this whisky with a lot more sherry character along with those woody, citrus spicy notes found in so many older whiskies. While not as clean as the distillery issue and its maltiness is somewhat masked, there’s a lot going on here to entertain the palate. And although one could argue that the sherry is a bit extreme, the equally extreme dry, spicy oak notes provide ample contrast.",135.0,86,,1.0
2250,John Hansell,"Finished (or ACE’d -- additional cask enhanced -- as they say) in a Madeira cask. Soft in texture, and deceivingly seductive in nature. Pleasingly sweet (honey, caramel, aromas of sticky toffee pudding) with lush summer fruit and gentle spice notes emerging towards the finish. A soft, pleasing Macallan with everything in balance. Nicely done.",125.0,86,46.0,1.0
2251,Dave Broom,"This time we’ve got Macallan in savory mode, even a little balsamic. The spirit shows its hand more than in the 1995, with typical Macallan heft. Now you are deep in a forest of yew and larch with a dark chocolate bar for sustenance. Maturity has brought out leather alongside clove and resin. The palate shows a similar tomato note seen in the 1995 cask, with positive bitterness and wedding cake. Though grippy, it has great balance. 285 bottles.",,86,50.8,1.0
2252,John Hansell,"Richly layered. A veritable fruit basket, in addition to nutty toffee, caramel, cocoa powder, and toasted coconut notes, all balanced nicely by oak on the finish. Nice maturity for a relatively young whisky. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)",95.0,86,58.5,1.0
2253,Dave Broom,"The richest of the quartet. Super-dense with a note of burnished brass, then light leather and cashew alongside sandalwood. The waxiness and tropical fruit typical of old whiskies is in the background before it moves into lanolin. The palate starts sweetly, with added liqueur cherries, earth, and smoke but for me, after the complex nose it fails to deliver, especially since it is so scarily priced. £600/500 ml",1013.0,86,43.4,1.0
2254,John Hansell,"Fresh, briny, and very appetizing. Mouth-coating vanilla, lightly toasted marshmallow, and a kiss of honey add a soothing balance, while pineapple, nectarine, gentle spice, and subtle seaweed offer intrigue. Old Pulteney has great potential if only given the opportunity. Bottling at cask strength and not chill-filtered really brings out more of the whisky’s subtle complexities.

2257,Gavin Smith,"Duncansby Head has been aged in a mixture of bourbon and Spanish sherry casks. The nose is initially slightly earthy; then Old Pulteney’s characteristic marine nature develops discreetly, along with icing sugar sprinkled on apple pie and a hint of roasted potato skins.

2259,John Hansell,"Port Ellen whiskies are getting pretty rare (and expensive). This one is softer and less vibrant than others that I’ve tasted, but still very much Port Ellen, and still enjoyable! Notes of coal tar, rooty licorice, toffee, dark chocolate, and nougat, with background citrus gumdrops, ginger, brine, seaweed, peat bog, and damp oak. I think bottling this at 46% without chill-filtering, or perhaps even cask-strength, would have helped the flavors “zing"" (and elevated my rating).",280.0,86,43.0,1.0

2264,John Hansell,"(Reviewer's note: This is a bottling exclusive to Sam's Wine & Spirits in Chicago, IL.) Springbank bottlings over the past few years have been variable, but improving. The less inspiring ones have been too heavily sherried and/or lacked the classic Springbank freshness, liveliness, and briny character one has come to expect from a Campbeltown whisky. This one is indeed from a sherry cask. It's still not the classic Springbanks we were spoiled with in the 1990s, but it's delicious nonetheless. Yes, there's plenty of sherry (and these notes contribute lush fruit, toffee, and nuts), but the youth and zest of this whisky cuts through it and balances it nicely, with those familiar brine and coconut notes interwoven throughout.

But it’s this malt that will probably attract the most interest. Glengyle was officially re-opened in 2004, and in recent years Springbank has released a work in progress each year. What makes this unusual is the fact that the maturing malt is held in a cask which is kept at least half full, and each year it is topped up with malt from 2004, through the solera method. This year, then, the oldest malt is six years old. The nose definitely suggests a work in progress, and is immature, rootsy, and meaty, though some orange and citrus fruit notes are there, too.

2271,Dave Broom,"The immediate shore-like blast suggests that the sweet amoroso casks haven’t been overly enthusiastic in their embrace. What seems to have happened is that while giving some date and prune they have added an extra layer of oak — giving a charred element — and, like Lagavulin, hints of tar.

Spicy and drying on the slightly waxy palate, with licorice, aniseed, and prominent peat embers. The finish is medium in length, peppery, and relatively tannic. £225",353.0,86,45.8,1.0
2273,Gavin Smith,"As it progresses toward the ultimate goal of an 18 year old expression in 2015, Arran has released a 16 year old, matured in 30
percent sherry hogsheads and 70 percent bourbon casks. The edition is limited to 9,000 bottles. The nose features malt, milk chocolate, and honey, with a citric edge. The palate mirrors the nose with more malt, honey, and milk chocolate, plus ginger, nutmeg, and spicy oak. Spiced fruits in the lengthy finish. £45",69.0,86,45.8,1.0
2274,John Hansell,"Not all Speyside whiskies are big, masculine, and sherried. Some are gentler, as is this expression of Tamnavulin. The whisky is creamy and smooth in texture, with notes of vanilla custard, honeyed malt, and even a hint of marshmallow and hay. Very soothing finish. This is one of the most polished Tamnavulin whiskies I’ve tasted recently (and going from 40% to 43% in strength provided some extra richness and body). Whisky with dessert, anyone?",50.0,86,40.0,1.0
2275,Gavin Smith,"This 21 year old from Tobermory is of the peated Ledaig variety, though sampling confirms that the level of peating in Ledaig malt has been significantly ramped up since this was produced. Sweet on the nose, with subtle aromatic smoke, unsalted butter, peaches in syrup, and heather honey. Luscious and viscous on the sweet, fruity palate, with honey, underlying soft spices, and some gentle smoke. Slowly drying in the finish to licorice root and black coffee. £110",185.0,86,50.9,1.0
2276,John Hansell,"Fragrant and very clean. Gently sweet with notes of vanilla cream, ripe barley, fresh cut hay, sherbet (orange and lemon), and a hint of bourbon -especially on the finish. An enjoyable and undemanding whisky to drink when the whisky itself isn’t the main topic of conversation.",210.0,86,46.0,1.0
2277,John Hansell,"The ""Gentle Dram,"" it says on the bottle’s label, and it certainly is one of the gentler whiskies in Speyside. It’s a fragrant whisky too with a firm malty foundation, fruit gum drops and caramel. Subtle notes of almond and anise helped keep my interest, as did its soft, subtle wood spice finish. Very easy to drink too!",40.0,86,,1.0
2278,Gavin Smith,"The latest release from Tomatin distillery is a limited edition (3,150 bottles) 15 year old that has been matured in a combination of second-fill bourbon barrels and tempranillo wine casks (the grape of full-bodied Spanish reds like those from Rioja). The nose offers fruit cocktail and salted popcorn, while milk chocolate, vanilla, and nutty caramel notes emerge. Soft chocolate, bananas, and autumn berries on the slightly peppery palate. The finish is nutty, with lingering spice, peppery oak, and finally a lengthy, creamy sensation.",80.0,86,52.0,1.0
2279,Gavin Smith,"This portwood finish from Tomatin was matured for some 13 years in bourbon casks before being transferred for a final period of aging in Portuguese tawny port pipes, which had matured port for between 30 and 40 years. Initially reticent on the nose, with soft fruit notes, honey, and toffee, turning to cherry cough lozenges. Gently spiced on the nutty palate, with peaches and Cherryade. The finish is medium in length and always fruity.",55.0,86,46.0,1.0
2280,Gavin Smith,"Mashy peat notes on the early nose, then sherry, vanilla, and white pepper. Mouth-coating, with new leather and sweet spices on the palate. Gentle smokiness and black coffee gradually come to the fore. The finish is medium in length, with sweet, nutty peat which gradually dries.",50.0,86,46.0,1.0
2281,Gavin Smith,"Initially drier on the nose than the Fino expression, then caramel appears, along with milk chocolate and vanilla. More pronounced leathery notes than the Fino; fuller bodied and fruitier on the palate, with the fruit developing a salty tang. Lingering salty fruit and spices in the finish, with final dark chocolate.",50.0,86,46.0,1.0
2282,Gavin Smith,"Full sherry and old leather on the nose. Dried fruits, and finally a hint of meat extract. Rich, sweet, and sherried on the palate, with nutty spices. Medium to long in the spicy finish, with black currant and raisin notes.",50.0,86,46.0,1.0
2283,Gavin Smith,"Tomatin has released a limited edition (5,400) pack comprising two 350ml bottles, each containing a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. One was matured in bourbon barrels (see below); this one in sherry casks. Initially savory on the nose, then warm leather, sherry, and glacé cherries. Very smooth on the palate with soft spices, which increase in intensity. Black treacle and Seville oranges. Peppery treacle and old oak in the finish. £100",152.0,86,46.0,1.0
2284,Gavin Smith,"This is the third in a trilogy of limited releases from Tomatin, featuring the different cask types used to mature components of the standard, lightly peated Cù Bòcan variant. It follows Sherry Edition and Virgin Oak expressions. Initially, crisp green apples on the nose, then developing vanilla and caramel. Sweet, smoky apple and cinnamon. Soft and sweet on the early palate, with quite dry smoke evolving along with dark spices. Licorice and aniseed in the finish, with a citric tang. £50",76.0,86,46.0,1.0
2285,Gavin Smith,"This rested in bourbon barrels for almost 18 years until May 2013 when it was transferred to oloroso sherry hogsheads for a prolonged period of finishing. Big, waxy, warm leather notes on the nose, then dried fruit and machine oil. The palate is smooth, with cinnamon, cloves, sherry-soaked raisins, and dates. Spicy leather, plain chocolate, and slightly tannic oak in the very lengthy finish (1,800 bottles) £100",125.0,86,46.0,1.0
2286,Gavin Smith,"The latest Tullibardine vintage release to hit the States is another example of whisky distilled in 1993, but now bottled at 18 years of age. The initial nose features cut grass and sliced melon, with freshly-peeled tree bark. Intensifying sweetness with time. Quite rich and full on the palate, with cereal, soft fudge, and mild ginger. The finish is medium in length, insistently spicy, with oak and vanilla notes.",65.0,86,46.0,1.0
2287,Gavin Smith,"This 20 year old expression of Tullibardine has been aged in first-fill bourbon barrels, like its younger stablemate Sovereign. Caramel, honey, cocoa, and a hint of linseed oil on the nose. The palate is creamy, with strawberries, warm milk chocolate, and allspice. Long and soft in the finish, which is reminiscent of choc-ice. At 20, this single malt has gained in richness and sophistication, with an extremely enticing flavor profile.",125.0,86,43.0,1.0
2290,Lew Bryson,"High West has a second version of Valley Tan. The “Utah oat whiskey” was distilled to 87.5% (about the same proof as single pot still Irish, and technically a “light whiskey”), aged 2 to 4 years in new and used cooperage. A light golden color; nose is somewhat spicy, with a licorice/peppermint tinge and some alcohol heat. It's quite smooth, almost Irish in its drinkability, with grainy notes graced with that light peppermint and biscuit sweetness. Pleasant sipper indeed.",50.0,86,42.0,3.0
2296,Lew Bryson,"Bear Republic’s Racer 5 IPA has long been a beloved California craft beer. Charbay distiller Marko Karakasevic liked it so much he made whiskey from it. The Clear (aged 22 months in stainless tanks) sings with hoppy citrus zest and pine notes set in a sweet background. It’s nicely nuanced in the mouth, though, with a creamy body that sparkles with bitter orange and grapefruit floating over understated malt. Preferred over his Doubled & Twisted; this is more sophisticated.",54.0,86,49.5,3.0
2297,Lew Bryson,"After 6 years aging in charred new oak, and 8 years in “non-oak vessels” (stainless tanks), there’s a nose of oak, cedar, tart red plums, gooseberries, and fresh putty, but none of the heat you’d expect. Explosive in the mouth: sweet fruit and dry oak slam-dance and set off a surprising burst of hops (wash was craft-brewed pilsner). Exciting stuff, but a bit hot, even with water. (2,713 bottles released)",425.0,86,66.5,3.0
2298,Gavin Smith,"This expression of the triple-distilled Lowland single malt is a 14 year old single cask bottling, and just 314 bottles are available. Fresh pineapple and vanilla toffee on the fragrant, soft nose. The palate is lively and fruity, with lemon zest, caramel, a hint of black pepper, and then deeper fruit notes of ripe peach. The finish is quite lengthy, with lingering fruit flavors. £55",87.0,86,46.0,1.0
2299,Dominic Roskrow,"It's not often that the blended whisky section can be described as 'the group of death' but at most other times this whisky would shine. It's a very good whisky, rich in flavor and punching above its 40% ABV, mixing creamy vanilla, pureed peach and apricot, key lime pie, chocolate, and manuka honey to great effect. It's soft and rounded, with little obvious oak, and the finish is feather-light, with a slightly fruit sponge finale. £50",79.0,86,40.0,1.0
2300,Dave Broom,"Rich and malty and, though it’ll look like I’m just reading the label, there is
chocolate here: chocolate brownie mix to be precise, with a raspberry sitting
on top. Bold and rich, with a nutty underpinning. Water makes it very fresh and
a little more hay-like. The palate is sweet and liquorous, with nougat,
macadamia, and a chewy mid-palate where that chocolate dribbles and melts.
Neat, it is slightly bitter; less so with water. Very sound. £53",81.0,86,46.0,1.0
2301,Gavin Smith,"The latest batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts includes this 22 year old expression of Glen Scotia, matured in a bourbon barrel that provided 304 bottles. The nose offers soft spices, orchard fruits, and a faint hint of ozone. Richly fruity on the palate, with mandarin oranges, vanilla, and a sprinkling of sea salt. The finish is gingery and warming, with light smoke, aniseed, and plain chocolate at the close. £100",159.0,86,46.0,1.0
2302,Gavin Smith,"The first batch of single cask releases from Wemyss Malts in 2015 includes this 1999 bottling from Aberfeldy. The hogshead yielded 379 bottles. The nose opens with overripe bananas, followed by peaches, gingerbread, treacle, subtle smokiness, and vanilla custard. The whisky really earns its sobriquet with a waxy mouthfeel and a little more smoke, ripe eating apples, and ginger on the palate. The spicy finish dries slowly to plain chocolate and aniseed. £88",129.0,86,46.0,1.0
2303,Gavin Smith,"The oldest bottling in Wemyss Malts’ March 2015 batch of six releases, Foraged Fruit Fool was aged in a bourbon barrel. Orchard fruits, double cream, vanilla, and ginger on the enticing nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, supple, becoming nuttier, with gentle spices. The finish is quite lengthy, with fruit bonbons, allspice, and prickly oak. (330 bottles) £120",176.0,86,46.0,1.0
2304,Gavin Smith,"From a refill sherry butt, this bottling of Glen Scotia was released in September 2015 as a 24 year old. Oily on the nose, with dirty sherry, ginger, chili, coconut, new leather, and cocoa. The palate is viscous with treacle, dark berries, licorice, and more chili. Gingery and drying in the finish, with white salt and developing black pepper. (737 bottles) £90",129.0,86,46.0,1.0
2305,Gavin Smith,"This Clynelish was matured in a refill hogshead and has been released as part of Wemyss Malts’ Single Cask Releases series. The nose yields light caramel, ozone, warm tweed, and soft ginger. Smooth and supple on the palate; soft spices, tangerines, and subtle, spicy oak. Chili notes on the relatively long finish. (341 bottles) £85",122.0,86,46.0,1.0
2306,Gavin Smith,"From Wemyss Malts’ Midsummer Single Cask Releases, this bottling from Blair Athol was distilled in 1991 and bottled in 2015. Soft, sweet fruits as the nose opens—principally juicy pears. This is backed up by malt and cinnamon. Very smooth and inviting on the palate, with honey, brittle toffee, gentle spices, darker malt, and walnuts. Slightly mouth-drying in the finish, with cocoa powder and lingering spice. (312 bottles) £115",150.0,86,46.0,
2309,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Since Canadian Club refined its batching process, this 12 year old whisky has begun to show pleasing differences among batches. And though a batch is exactly that, a batch, bottling codes reveal that different bottle sizes of a single batch can be filled weeks apart. Caramel, dark fruits, and luscious sweetness jump out of the glass to fill the room. Behind that, the classic Canadian Club pruniness, butterscotch, and hot pepper ride on a wagonload of dried oak timber.",23.0,86,40.0,
2313,Gavin Smith,"This 2016 release follows similar port and Madeira quarter cask-matured Kilchomans, with sauternes casks being pressed into service this time. The casks in question were sourced from Château d’Yquem and the whisky is 5 years old. Earthy peat, a savory note, vanilla, citrus fruit, and sweet wine on the nose, while the palate offers smoked haddock, tarry rope, and bonfire embers. The finish is relatively long, with fruity peat. (6,000 bottles)",100.0,86,50.0,1.0
2314,Gavin Smith,"Diageo is releasing five triple matured single malts, all exclusive to Friends of the Classic Malts and without age statements. Initial maturation was in refill casks, followed by a period in charred American oak hogsheads, and finally European oak refill casks. Sweet on the nose, with heather honey and gingerbread; slightly herbal. Resinous and waxy. Cloves, cinnamon, oak, and black pepper notes on the buttery palate. Medium length in the finish, with lingering cloves and freshly-sawn oak. £80",135.0,86,48.0,1.0
2315,Dave Broom,"Young it certainly is. Precocious even, and a pallid-looking youth on first impression, but behind that bland exterior is freshness and life with a fragrance that is very un-Balmenach, all chilled Muscat grapes, melon, even some cucumber. This general perfumed zinginess continues on the tongue, though the weight of the distillate (Balmenach has worm tubs) anchors it well. It’s not about age — it’s about character. Enjoy.",55.0,86,46.0,1.0
2316,Gavin Smith,"After 6 to 7 years of maturation in bourbon casks, this spent several months in chardonnay white wine casks. The nose offers resinous wine notes, melon, grapefruit, and a hint of vanilla. Nutty on the palate, with orchard fruits, more vanilla, and milk chocolate. Peaches and a slightly oily note in the finish, with apples, nutmeg, and a sprinkling of black pepper.",30.0,86,40.0,1.0
2317,Gavin Smith,"Highly approachable, with soft, earthy peat on the nose, plus pineapple, honey, and vanilla. Warm leather, ashy peat, ripe pears, and discreet vanilla notes on the palate. Slightly thinner than the unpeated Classic. Relatively long in the finish, with peppery peat and ultimately, aniseed.",30.0,86,40.0,1.0
2318,Gavin Smith,"After 6 to 7 years in a bourbon cask, this is finished for 9 to 12 months in oloroso casks. Sweet sherry, glacé cherries, butterscotch, and roses on the nose. Medium-bodied, with caramel, dark chocolate-cherry liqueur, and warming spices. The finish yields black currant, cough medicine, then allspice, and slowly drying oak.",30.0,86,40.0,
2322,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Once you get over any initial disappointment (there is no peat smoke), this is one engaging and mouthwatering whiskey; clean with malty cereal notes, golden raisins, bread dough, and freshly-sawn oak. The real clincher, however, is the captivating wisp of saline sea breeze echoing across a warming finish of cherry hard candies, rye spice, and salt brine. Medium-bodied, fresh, and delicious. (Distillery only) 375ml",49.0,86,45.0,3.0
2324,Fred Minnick,"Cornbread and toffee start this alluring whiskey, followed by hints of paprika, fruits, flowers, and caramel. Afterward, it opens up into a bakery with cinnamon rolls, caramel chews, vanilla cupcakes, and ginger. Baking spices and earth appear over a medium finish that offers black licorice. It’s well-suited for mixing.",23.0,86,50.0,2.0
2330,Gavin Smith,"The first Kilkerran “work in progress” bottling from Glengyle distillery appeared in 2009, and the ultimate aim is to bottle a 12 year old expression. For now, we have separate sherry butt-matured and bourbon barrel-matured expressions for 2013. The bourbon-aged variant offers vanilla, cinnamon, milk chocolate, ripe apples, and ultimately, slightly smoky mango notes on the nose. Spicy on the palate, with blood orange and a hint of peat smoke. The medium-length finish is drying, with a wisp of smoke. £38",58.0,86,46.0,1.0
2331,Dave Broom,"Here is Auchroisk at its more lifted and clean. A whiff of cooking lentils (a lovely smell) alongside lime and cottage cheese (again nice), it gives the impression of a healthy salad. The palate is sweet and quite buttery, with minimal attention from oak; instead it’s all very spring-like, with good mid-palate sweetness. Water dries it slightly, but also extends the palate. Quite lovely.",120.0,86,48.8,1.0
2332,John Hansell,"The new, elder sibling to the standard Bulleit. It shows the Bulleit personality, but it’s deeper and drier on the nose and palate (as would be expected), with more oak, dried orchard fruit, and dark berried fruit, along with a hint of barrel char, leather, vanilla powder, and a dusting of cinnamon. I’d save this as a postprandial bourbon, and opt for the standard Bulleit as an aperitif.",45.0,86,45.6,2.0
2333,Gavin Smith,"Speyburn’s entry level NAS single malt takes its name from the Gaelic term for “golden salmon” and was matured in bourbon casks. The nose is light and youthful, with malt, vanilla, and unripe apples, while the palate offers more malt and vanilla, plus dry, spicy oak. The finish is medium in length and grassy, with ginger and further dry oak.",20.0,86,40.0,1.0
2334,Dave Broom,"Mature on the nose, mixing the tropical fruits of age with blanched almond. As it opens, you encounter Moscato grapes dusted with white pepper. Grows in sweetness. The palate continues this theme with the fruits (blueberry, raspberry, and pomegranate) typical of the distillery character, given a waxy coating by age. Unctuous and good. Water rather pulls the flesh from the bones, revealing its age, so leave well enough alone. (3,756 bottles)",1250.0,86,59.8,1.0
2335,Gavin Smith,"This expression from Springbank Distillery is taking over from its highly regarded 12 year old sibling. It is unpeated, distilled three times, and matured in bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is gently floral, with pears, toffee, and soft oak, then emerging herbal tobacco notes. The palate is full and slightly oily, with cream, orchard fruits, cinnamon, and sea salt. The finish is long, with vanilla and cocoa powder.",45.0,86,46.0,1.0
2336,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Made from malted Bavarian hard wheat and aged over 2 years in new and used American oak barrels, the nose is chocolate-covered pretzels and a dash of pepper spice with a slight edge. The entry is much softer than expected at this proof, driven by toasted wheat and dark chocolate, with vanilla and black pepper. A strong pepper kick at the end of the mid-palate drives a long, spicy finish. A surprisingly well-balanced and actualized young craft whiskey.",75.0,86,50.0,3.0
2337,Lew Bryson,"Sweet reek of the warehouse; sugary bourbon drooling and drying on oak staves, the richly boozy air, dusty wood. It’s all here, like Bardstown in a bottle. Enters with authority, a hot rush of corn, solidly oak-edged, sizzling with allspice and cinnamon, and backed with a solid strop of leather. Then the sun comes up: a sweet, glowing finish. Beautifully bridges the gap between young and old bourbon, and an absolute steal at the price.",15.0,86,50.0,2.0
2338,Lew Bryson,"Certified organic, “aged under four years.” Oak is forward on the nose—young and fresh-sawn—with sweet spicy hard candies: cinnamon and teaberry. Juicy in the mouth: sweet, springing with that spice-fruit bounce off an oak board. Rye oil hides in the back, then slides forward with the oak to take over the finish. Dynamic. I haven't been a big Koval fan, but we're definitely on the right path here.",50.0,86,47.0,
2339,Lew Bryson,"Catoctin Creek’s first malt whiskey, made from wash brewed by Heritage Brewing of Manassas, Va., aged in used Catoctin Creek whiskey barrels. Light floral notes, fresh-cut pencil lead, oak sawdust on the nose. Sweet and floral, but with a firm backbone of oak and dry malt, leading to a finish of candied oak: juicy-sweet but hard-cored. The profile is definitely Catoctin Creek whiskey, which is great to see in a young distillery trying something new. Well done. (344 bottles, distillery only)",119.0,86,46.0,3.0
2340,Dave Broom,"The dark color shouts “sherried!” and the nose confirms. After an initial blast of marzipan there’s rosin, stewed Assam tea, some licorice, hard treacle toffee, truffle, and a charred element, all backed with an earthy undertow. The palate is tight and quite hot, with charred red pepper and a bosky, wooded note. Not a great fan of water — this is about that deep, fungal stuff — there’s an uplift of sweet dark fruits at the end, offering balance. £105",165.0,86,58.1,1.0
2346,Lew Bryson,"Hot wet oak, berries, Red Hots, and wet cornmeal. Closer to the nose, it’s sharper and woodier. Lots of wood on the entry, but sweet corn and cloved hard candy, too, with heat from the 100 proof that lingers through the oaky finish. At 7 years, this is extra-spicy, and a touch of water tames the heat and the oak. Bowman’s still finding its way, but the path seems right.",70.0,86,50.0,2.0
2347,Davin de Kergommeaux,"J.P. Wiser’s signature is on the label, but the whisky itself bears the toasted-oak hallmarks of Corby master blender Dr. Don Livermore. There’s a lot to enjoy in this creamy, lush whisky. An initial blast of sweet caramel lingers as sour rye and bitter citrus pith emerge. These soon grow into hot gingery fizz and burned toffee. Dark fruits turn to citrus notes and cherry licorice while sizzling ginger mellows into softly glowing white pepper.",23.0,86,40.0,
2348,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Blending two types of 100% rye with creamy corn whisky creates a complex dram that feels as good as it tastes. Sizzling peppers and nutty grains playfully torment fresh-cut cedar and dry oak, all on a comforting blanket of butterscotch. Street-roasted chestnuts and coffee beans bring depth. Pepper dominates, yet the mouth feels soft and sweet. Otherwise-muted fruity and floral notes blossom with a dash of water. (Canada only) C$29",22.0,86,43.4,4.0
2350,Lew Bryson,"A hot and spicy nose: dry rye, sweet mint, and alcohol heat. Hot on the tongue too, with the mint flashing across an oily graininess. The finish is where it finally cools down, laying down thin layers of sweet mint and light chocolate on the palate. Water tames the heat and brings out more chocolate, but steals that nice finish. Not overly approachable, but…it’s rye.",45.0,86,46.0,3.0
2351,Lew Bryson,"That’s “.36” as in ’36 caliber,’ the first of this Texas distiller’s Small Caliber Series of Texas bourbon whiskeys. Sharpish on the nose with some hot alcohol, cinnamon, and oak, warmed by burnt sugar and vanilla. A kick of hot oak spice on the tongue, a flush of hot, dry corn, and flashes of mint and vanilla, then a long, spicy finish with more dry mint. One of the better young bourbons — only 8 months — I’ve had. Price is per 375 ml.",35.0,86,48.0,3.0
2352,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Baking spices, pipe tobacco, vanilla, citrus peel, cardamom, dried apricots, and dates unwind on the nose, carried by plenty of fresh oak. The potent palate explodes with up-front sweetness, laced with cocoa and maduro tobacco notes, but the chest-thumping herbal oak brings it to a quick and slightly bitter finish. A splash of water brings the elements into better balance as peach syrup sweetness starts to shine.",80.0,86,68.3,3.0
2355,Geoffrey Kleinman,"An unabashedly spicy rye nose backed by cinnamon, marzipan, Bartlett pear, and oak. The rye spice is right there on the palate and immediately joined by cinnamon, clove, black pepper, solid oak, and a lingering pear note on the fringe. The finish is long, dry, and spicy with a hint of black licorice candy. Pritchard’s rye is a perfect example of how you can have strong spice without a lot of fire, and create balance without adding a lot of sweetness.",50.0,86,40.0,3.0
2358,John Hansell,"Sourced from several undisclosed Kentucky bourbon distillers. Well-rounded and nicely balanced, with prominent spice (cinnamon, clove, evergreen, powdered vanilla), soft fruit (mandarin, coconut, apricot, hint of pineapple), and toasted nuts, all on a bed of caramel. Very versatile: mature enough for pleasurable sipping (but just), and youthful enough to add zing to a cocktail.",34.0,86,43.0,
2363,Gavin Smith,"This veteran Old Malt Cask offering was distilled in Glen Mhor, Inverness during 1982. The early nose is very fruity, with Jelly Babies, then icing sugar and almonds come through, accompanied by supple malt. A good mouthfeel, with the fruitiness following on from the nose, joined by spicy toffee, a wisp of wood smoke, and old oak. The finish is medium to long, slightly resinous, and citric with a dash of cocoa and a hint of peat.  £115",179.0,86,50.0,1.0
2365,John Hansell,"This new Jack Daniel’s offering is marketed as being “bold and smooth.” It certainly is bolder when compared to the standard Jack Daniel’s offering, with a mélange of corn, creamy vanilla, toasted caramel, bright citrus, and dry resinous oak spiked with cinnamon. The smoothness ends, however, when the oak grip intensifies on the finish. Adding ice does tame the oak, if that’s your thing. Still, I’d prefer the oak be more restrained. Price is per liter.",165.0,86,45.0,2.0
2366,Davin de Kergommeaux,"In June 2013, flooding washed away most of Highwood’s finished whisky. Although barrels in the warehouse went unscathed, new releases such as this one have been limited. Too bad. Initial nose tickle erupts into sweet caramel and rich black fruits. Hot pepper trickling down your throat leaves a lovely hot burn followed by waves of sweet saltwater taffy. Yes, it’s slightly salty. Weighty and mouth-coating, this whisky feels big and full in the mouth. (Alberta/British Columbia only.) C$28",28.0,86,45.0,4.0
2367,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This export-only Pike Creek reminds us of the year-to-year differences we can expect from whisky that spends Canada’s brutal winters (and sweltering summers) in unheated warehouses. Slightly younger than the Canada-only version, this is just different enough to be its own whisky. Gingery hot pepper laces its way through sweet, ripe red fruit as vague menthol with a slight herbal edge slips gently into silky oak tannins. Finishes cleanly with a citrus pithiness.",32.0,86,40.0,4.0
2370,Jonny McCormick,"Few single malt whiskies from the Speyside Distillery make it to the U.S. This noses like a gammon joint glazed with sliced orange and a side order of sugar mice. Hesitantly, a sip brings relief with dark chocolate, stewed rhubarb, strained raspberry juices, walnut, and burnt bakery goods. Dry finish with remnants of cocoa. Worth experimenting with water, as lovely candied peel and golden syrup notes peek out.",52.0,86,53.4,
2371,Jonny McCormick,"An aged island dram to mull over during the distillery’s lengthy closure for essential upgrades, this brims with lemon sherbet, summer fruits including cantaloupe, and Bartlett pears poached in cream. Tangy citrus balanced with ginger and peppery spice, cocoa notes, and black bun make for a lively mouthfeel. Creamy fudge and Jaffa cake rule once the spices die back. An enchantingly delicate orange sorbet flavor appears when diluted.",65.0,86,51.2,1.0
2372,Jonny McCormick,"Lemon meringue pie, flaked almonds, cereal bars, almost porridge-like, enlivened by the tiniest pinch of allspice. A ferocious peppery intensity saves itself for the palate, where it tramples all over the lemon zest and apple flavors without mercy. Once the conquering spices call it a day, this is a sweeter concoction, with soft fudge, brown sugar, and blueberry muffin. In the finish, the allspice has the final word. (Batch 3; 162 bottles)",90.0,86,47.9,1.0
2376,Gavin Smith,"Bottled by Ian Macleod Distillers from an undisclosed producer, this Islay single malt may well emanate from Ardbeg. The nose offers lemon, rock pools, peat ash, and smoky malt, with a sweet, honeyed floral note at its heart. Medium-bodied, with big citrus flavors, tingling spices, brine, ashy peat, and aniseed. Aniseed lingers in the finish, with diminishing spiciness.",60.0,86,40.0,1.0
2377,Fred Minnick,"Think corn: roasted, canned, creamed, mashed, pan-fried, in salsa, and in bread. The corn pops early and often. This complements hazelnut, caramel pudding, and baking spices. A drop of water really opens this up, softening the corn-heavy notes and bringing forth fruits and spices. Even the finish is better with water. Perhaps this whiskey was meant to have a lower proof.",75.0,86,63.7,
2378,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"This is a bold style of bourbon, finished in American brandy barrels and brandishing fiery spirit and sweet corn. Yet the beautiful sweetness, layered with butter and spearmint underscored by cedary oak, offers a lot to like, especially on the nutty-sweet finish, with its peanut and charred wood flavors.",50.0,86,46.5,3.0
2379,Fred Minnick,"This blend of 6 to 8 year old bourbon is finished for 3 to 4 months in casks that aged Cognac for 12 years. There’s fruit, especially dried apricot, pear, passion fruit, grapefruit, and cherry. Then caramel, oak, leather, tobacco, vanilla, and a slight hint of cinnamon. Honestly, there’s a textural brandy-and-bourbon struggle, but beautiful vanilla and nutmeg surface, ensuring it is indeed bourbon. A muted spice comes toward the end with rich caramel. Solid sipper.",75.0,86,45.2,2.0
2380,Davin de Kergommeaux,"What a difference a cask can make. This first-fill bourbon barrel has more robust flavors but noticeably less color than its antecedent, Cask 1. Linseed oil, raw canvas, and freshly dug blue clay form a rich, earthy base for flourishes of clean spirit, dry straw, and Chinese plum sauce. Hot pepper and pulling dry wood yield to
cherry blossoms, maraschino, and sautéed mushrooms. A splash of water unveils milk chocolate, rye crisps, and creamy custard. C$100",100.0,86,61.3,4.0
2381,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Rye grain, Bavarian sour rye bread, rich linseed oil, and vague hints of peppermint drift out of the bottle when you first pull the cork. The sweet, oily palate is alive with ginger and wasabi, accented by acetone, high fruity esters, and teasing hints of sweet flowers. Notes of plasticine and the earthiness of river plants add complexity. The whisky sizzles with pepper throughout, returning to sour rye as the finish fades ever so slowly.",70.0,86,46.0,4.0
2382,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Rye flour, powerful rye spices—hot, sweet, and flavorful—bathed in flaxseed oil. Fragrant hints of breakfast tea blend with ripe dark fruit, peaches, and rich lilac perfume. Sweet and sour, and quite peppery, with a long finish. Made with nothing but rye grain, yet there is a certain slippery quality more commonly found in corn whisky. This is Still Waters distillery at its best.",70.0,86,46.0,
2383,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Seven years after distilling their first drop, Still Waters can barely keep up with demand. The single malt distillery took a giant step forward when partners Barry Stein and Barry Bernstein decided to mash some rye grain. Rye is now more than half of their production. Waxy, sizzling-hot spices and a lovely leafy sweetness lead to softer peppers, hints of vanilla, and a mildly floral palate. Linseed oil and a slippery palate suggest chocolate, but only just.",70.0,86,46.0,4.0
2385,Lew Bryson,"Full oaky nose, with the brash power of youth. Zingy and bright, with corn, sweet and hot mint, chunky oak, and a warm, spicy-sweet finish. On the front edge of the bell curve for 4 to 6 year old bourbons; plenty of spunk. Not for someone who wants a mellow glass, this one's lively. Sourced whiskey.",17.0,86,40.0,2.0
2386,Lew Bryson,"A 70/20/10% mashbill (corn/wheat/malt), aged 32 months. A sweet corn, citrus-tipped nose, not as hot as expected. Hot on the tongue, though, and spreads like fire. Dynamic balance of sweet corn and spicy candy with crimping oak spice and alcohol heat. Finish is like fireworks: a rush to an explosion of sweet, oaky heat in the back of the mouth, with a slow spark rain that sparkles on the tongue. Exciting.",45.0,86,52.5,
2387,Gavin Smith,"The Old Particular non-chill filtered single cask expression of Highland Park was distilled in November 1995, matured in a refill hogshead, and bottled in December 2013. The outturn was 322 bottles. Initially quite reticent on the nose, then toffee, cardboard, table salt, and very faint smoke. Quite viscous on the palate, and dry peat becomes relatively prominent, with allspice and sea salt. The finish offers licorice and lingering spices. £100",169.0,86,48.4,1.0
2388,Dave Broom,"What would you expect from an 8 year old Laphroaig? Iodine, massive peat, aggression? Not here. Rather, there’s a soft marine sweetness akin to lobster thermidor, with hints of salinity and tarragon. It builds in heft, and smoke, but there is real balance. Complex already. The palate initially shows muted smoke, and is slightly medicinal, with balancing creaminess. Water shatters this idyll somewhat, as the phenols come out in full force. It depends what side you want. I’d grab some. £60",92.0,86,46.0,1.0
2389,Dave Broom,"Rich gold. Here we have a good example of Bunna’ in full ‘welcome home to a warm house after a cold walk’ mode. Warm, sweet, steamy, with a light mineral note, dried fruit, walnut, and that giveaway gingerbread signature. The palate is clean, spicy, and drier than the nose suggests, but has a soft center. A lovely dram for a chill summer evening. £75",110.0,86,48.4,1.0
2390,Gavin Smith,"This Highland Park bottling appears in Douglas Laing’s prestigious XOP range, and after distillation in September 1994 the spirit in question was matured in a single refill hogshead (#10897) before bottling in September 2015. The outturn is just 228 bottles. Boiled fruit sweets and malt on the nose, with underlying sea salt and gentle, leathery smoke. Confident in the mouth, with allspice, honey, barley, and wood smoke. The finish is lengthy, with drying oak and peat. £155",224.0,86,52.6,1.0
2391,Gavin Smith,"A 27 year old offering from Glenturret, in Perthshire, this bottling is from a refill hogshead that was filled in December 1988. Fresh mango and ripe peaches on the early nose, followed by a slightly smoky, earthy note. Viscous on the palate, with orchard fruit notes, coconut, caramel, and nutmeg. Drying in the finish, with mildly tannic oak, black pepper, and a final flourish of citrus. (264 bottles) £110",144.0,86,45.4,1.0
2392,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in September 1995, and after 20 years maturing in a refill hogshead this Aberdeenshire single malt was bottled in February 2016. The nose is soft, with ginger, lots of floral notes, cinnamon, and vanilla. Sweet and malty on the mature palate, with banana, honey, milk chocolate, and cocoa, plus big cinnamon and nutmeg spice notes. Drying in the finish, with a drizzle of lemon juice and then black pepper. (254 bottles) £80",105.0,86,51.5,
2395,Geoffrey Kleinman,"This cask strength whisky is malty in the nose, along with peach, nectarine, and subtle oak. The entry is all malt, the kind of flavor that evokes ""malt reverence."" In the mid-palate it’s cereal grains spiced with allspice and black pepper. The finish is long and slightly salty, with a fair amount of heat from the alcohol, and a touch of oak. If you love the singular flavor of malt, this one may be for you. (U.S. only)",150.0,86,52.5,1.0
2396,Jonny McCormick,"An uplifting nose of golden honey, linseed oil, vanilla, sanded oak, and wheat biscuits on this west coast grain. Neat, it is mouth drenching. Banana and ripe fruits are followed by juicy orange before a snarling pepper onslaught ensnares the tip of the tongue, igniting a glowing ball of white heat underneath. You can bask in this experience for minutes with each sip. Water emphasizes the oak and mellows the dram to the flavor of almond-sprinkled custard. (180 bottles)",180.0,86,53.4,1.0
2397,Gavin Smith,"This single cask, cask-strength bottling was matured in a port hogshead. Slightly sharp on the initial nose, savory, and a touch vegetal. The palate is full and malty, offering creamy toffee, hazelnuts, ripe peaches, and ginger. Creaminess lasts through the cinnamon-spiced medium-length finish. (290 bottles)",100.0,86,58.4,1.0
2400,Gavin Smith,"Cask # 1013 from Edradour was filled on March 5th, 2002 and bottled on February 26th, 2014 at 11 years of age. It has not been chill filtered and is offered at natural color. The nose yields sultanas, cloves, and sherry, plus an earthy aroma and a hint of machine oil. The palate is silky, with sweet sherry, digestive biscuits, soft spices, dates, and figs. The finish is medium and fruity, with dark chocolate-covered candy. £42",67.0,86,46.0,1.0
2402,Gavin Smith,"A 1996 expression is the latest Clynelish to take its place in the Connoisseurs’ Choice lineup. Maturation occurred in refill sherry butts. Fruity on the nose, with ripe bananas, malt, dark toffee, lemongrass, and a splash of brine. Ultimately, a green, herbal note. Relatively full-bodied, creamy and slightly waxy on the palate; spicy sherry, Golden Delicious apples, and old leather. The finish is medium to long, with lingering ginger. £60",101.0,86,46.0,
2403,Gavin Smith,"Independent bottler Gordon & MacPhail offers a variety of Balblair expressions, including a 1969 vintage and this 10 year old in their Distillery Labels series. Matured in a mixture of refill sherry hogsheads and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose offers rich, warm fruits, vanilla, sherry, maraschino cherries, and ultimately toffee and orange blossom. Medium-bodied, sweet and fruity, with nutty milk chocolate, white pepper, and zesty spice. Slowly drying in the finish with licorice and light oak.",45.0,86,43.0,1.0
2404,Gavin Smith,"Sweet on the nose, with malt, stewed apple, apricots, sherry, and warm spices. Finally, caramel. Quite viscous in the mouth; the palate continues the sweet, malty, spicy theme. Ginger and soft fruits in the medium-length finish. Straightforward and very drinkable.

2406,Fred Minnick,"Caramel and cigar box lead the way, but leather comes in strong, followed by oak, earth, and mushrooms. On the palate, Nutella and roasted almonds resonate over crème brûlée, salt water taffy, vanilla icing, and nutmeg, with slight hints of apple and pineapple, at which point I think it really starts to pick up and take on some complexity. Alas, the short finish hurts what was a delightful experience.",120.0,86,45.3,2.0
2408,Lew Bryson,"While it’s not technically a grain, buckwheat makes great pancakes, so buckwheat whiskey? Otay! This has an earthy aroma of hickory nuts and autumn leaves with some cinnamon peeking through; reminds me of Corsair’s quinoa whiskey. There’s a cushioned, creamy mouthfeel, more raw nuts, a keen of oak, a sweet lift through the mouth, and at the end, the leaves and more oak. Unique, intriguing, compelling; I keep going back for one more taste. Price is per 375 ml.",35.0,86,42.5,3.0
2409,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Single barrel releases aren’t uncommon at craft bars, but a whiskey distilled by the bar’s proprietor is rare. Dark amber color suggests high barrel impact, but the wood is actually well balanced by caramel, milk chocolate, and honey-nut cereal. The opening is much softer, lusher than you’d expect at this proof, and balances in the mid-palate with oak, salt, cinnamon, and a little heat. A dry finish rounds out a unique and flavorful whiskey. (less than 50 bottles; Grandten Distilling’s South Boston store only)",50.0,86,52.5,3.0
2412,Dave Broom,"Light amber with that touch of acetone, along with marzipan, green apple, fruit blossom, and a runny caramel toffee/crème brûlée which adds width, while toasty oak and ginger biscuit give structure and spice. Again, a lovely, almost oily feel — it’s Dewar’s equivalent of Linkwood — balancing fragrance with surprising depth in the mouth. Water brings the oak into play and tightens the palate. (Travel Retail only) £125",199.0,86,46.0,
2413,Lew Bryson,"Razor-sharp aromas of clove, seasoned wood, and dried grass push firmly out of the glass. Hard-edged grain and spice continue on the palate, but without the harshness you might expect from young whiskey with such a bold nose. It softens toward the finish and becomes sweeter, with a hint of buttery fudge, then develops an oaky dryness at the end. Impressive young whiskey.",100.0,86,43.0,3.0
2414,Lew Bryson,"Sweet malt, old fruit pastilles (less intense), and subtle mesquite smoke. Unlike some craft smoked whiskeys, this doesn’t grab you by the throat; it’s enticing. Bigger on the tongue, but still not overwhelming, and there’s some dark, spicy chocolate and pepper coming out.",50.0,86,46.0,2.0
2419,Lew Bryson,"Mild and mellow nose of corn and oak, with a bit of warehouse reek, and a light, cleanly earthy note. Smooth and sweet in the mouth, with sweet cornmeal and sunny meadowgrass, a touch of candied cinnamon. A very friendly and easy-going bourbon, not too young, not too old. Sourced whiskey.",55.0,86,46.0,3.0
2420,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A rare barrel strength 100% rye release from a craft distiller. (Dark Horse, Lenexa, Kan.) No age statement on this other than “less than four years.” Young wood leads things off with pencil, graphite, and sawdust. Once you get past the sharp wood, there’s lush maple, brown sugar, cinnamon, and rye spice. At 113 proof it’s still soft, supple, and lush but slightly tannic. The finish is spicy but not overly hot or dry. Great distilling hampered by small barrels, but still something special.",62.0,86,56.8,3.0
2421,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Aromas of woodsmoke with hints of hot tar and rubber are draped over ripe berry fruit. Dark and somewhat brash, it comes off a touch hot, fully revealing its 100 proof, becoming more fruit driven on the palate, as sweet berry, buckwheat honey, and sorghum syrup give way to smoldering baking spice on the drying, oak-laced finish. More muscle than finesse, however the 21% Quercus garryana is revealing itself more in this second iteration.",150.0,86,50.0,3.0
2422,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Briney sea air, wet stones, and pretty wisps of campfire smoke give this a strong Scottish bent, while the medium-bodied palate nicely balances the sweet malt, salt, and smoke in a bit of salt water taffy. Showing nice complexity and balance overall, the finish smolders and evolves to become more herbaceous.",80.0,86,46.0,3.0
2425,Lew Bryson,"A blend: 89% 2 year 6 month old MGP bourbon, 11% 3 year old McKenzie rye. Other batches are different whiskeys. Sweet nose: some cinnamon and allspice, dried hay and “clear toy” candies. Hot on the tongue, with the spicy, peppery intensity of youth (and rye), and roars right on through to the end, where oak appears to add gravity to the finish. This would rock in a cocktail.",50.0,86,43.0,3.0
2426,Dave Broom,"Identifiably Caol Ila, with that light juniper note, lime, and very calm smoke. This sense of control continues as it opens very slowly into vanilla/cream with a little hint of salt, then fresh lychee. It is hot, so do water as this introduces a massively salty retro-nasal effect under which is this sweetly gentle mid-palate. Lovely balance.",120.0,86,54.4,
2431,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1996 and bottled in June 2015 after maturing in sherry casks, this Cooper’s Choice expression of Ben Nevis yields an initially savory character, with ripe figs, treacle, and a hint of tar. Quite chewy in the mouth, with spicy toffee and cherries, which develop into more citric fruit over time. The finish is lengthy and warming, with a hint of oak and black coffee.",115.0,86,46.0,1.0
2434,Lew Bryson,"Spicy, buttery nose (“aged six months with oak staves”) with some oak plank notes. Hey, that's pretty tasty! Rye character is spicy, forward, and flows surely right into the nicely warm finish. Michigan-grown rye done in a pot still in downtown Detroit, about a mile and a half from the Hiram Walker plant. Good young rye; one to watch.",50.0,86,47.0,3.0
2435,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Drinkers with a refined palate will enjoy the breadth and complexity of this whisky, the session drinker, its velvety smoothness. Barrel notes, from toasted vanilla to caramelized sugar and spicy cloves, give way to pickle-sour rye and bitter citrus pith. Searing peppers and ginger keep it exciting as dark fruits and black cherries fade to lime pith and peel. A long, glowing finish. (Australia only) $43 AUD",31.0,86,40.0,
2436,Lew Bryson,"Same mashbill as the Laws Four Grain, aged 4 years. Hard, dry corn aromas; no sulfur. Hot, straightforward corn and oak, with active spices. One of the leanest, most austere young bourbons I’ve ever tasted; no compromises, no lush sweetness: savory bourbon. The finish is great: tingling and tasty for a long time after the swallow. Not a bonded for cocktails; sip this.",75.0,86,50.0,
2437,Lew Bryson,"Mashbill of 95% rye, 5% malt; both Colorado-sourced. Aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Same grass and spice in the nose as the Straight Rye, but a sweet, almost sherry-like note as well. Flavors are similar—rye grain, bitter oil, alcohol heat—but there’s an added hit of dry cocoa, more heat, and a better, non-sticky finish with a grudging hint of sweetness at the end. Dialed up overall.",90.0,86,55.0,3.0
2438,Lew Bryson,"Scottish Highland malt whisky (from an undisclosed source; no age given), finished in Virginia, in Virginia port barrels. Rich port fumes hit the nose, malt’s in the background. Well-behaved in the mouth, not overly hot or obviously youthful, and the malt’s oily and luscious, with a nice port wrapper. Finish is cleanly integrated, without any heavy wood. Nice whiskey, interesting idea. Sourced whiskey.",58.0,86,46.0,
2439,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Distilled in western Canada, then shipped to Guysborough, Nova Scotia, Glynnevan is re-barreled for a final seaside stint. It’s authentic Seacoast Distilling Company-brewed beer prior to distilling into whisky. Brisk, spicy nose, with oak caramels, beeswax, hints of celery, and layers of green fruit. Luscious spicy palate loaded with citrus notes, vanilla beans, and pleasing bitter pith. Earthy, alongside wet slate and sweet spices. (Canada only) C$45",34.0,86,43.0,4.0
2440,Davin de Kergommeaux,"By finishing this blend of two sourced whiskies in its own maritime rum barrels, Authentic Seacoast Distillery gives this classic Canadian whisky a somehow tropical twist. Oily molasses undertones on the nose continue onto a spicy palate, which is syrupy but not slippery, with hints of wet slate, bananas, and heavy fruit. Barrel notes and suggestions of dry oak restrain an initially lush mouthfeel. (Nova Scotia only) $55 CAD",43.0,86,45.0,4.0
2443,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Crafted from estate-farmed organic grain and aged for 2 years. The flavors are impressively seamless, with nice complexity and everything neatly in its place. Fresh oak is well integrated with notes of orange rind, rosewater, sweet corn, and red fruits. The slick, buttery palate sizzles with peppery spice—cinnamon hearts candies and ginger. Robust in flavor, while showing impressive craftsmanship and polish. 375ml",42.0,86,45.0,3.0
2444,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Lavish red fruit and sherry blanket this whiskey, initially aged in American oak barrels followed by 12-18 months in oloroso sherry casks, to approach 5 years age in total. It may be the light toast of the initial barrels that allows this wheat whiskey to stand up exceptionally well, developing seamless flavors of figgy pudding, walnuts, chocolate-covered raisins, cacao nibs, and maple candy, culminating in a finish that nicely balances fruit and leathery oak. Carries its proof nicely.",80.0,86,51.0,3.0
2445,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Craft skeptics will find this very aligned to mainstream bourbon, with its enticing nose of Peanut Chews candy, gooey caramel, and cocoa powder. The palate pours on sweet cornbread and marzipan, just a touch hot and slightly antiseptic, before the long finish of cherry and sweet vanilla. Lots of good stuff going on here.",38.0,86,46.0,3.0
2446,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"This amber-hued whiskey seems part bourbon, part single malt, offering a nose of sweet dried fruits —raisin and apples—heaped with earthy, leathery oak. The palate is enjoyable for its crème caramel sweetness and drinkability, but the drying oak is a bit heavy-handed, overwhelming the medium body. A serviceable and versatile whiskey for the price. Corn, malted barley, wheat, and rye.",35.0,86,46.0,3.0
2447,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"The appealing nose features pretty biscuit notes, great purity of malt, and golden, honeyed sweetness, before adding some flavors of citrus blossom, clover, and cardamom with hints of licorice. On the palate, the initial sweet malt quickly turns herbal, with marjoram and a distinct sage note that lingers through a long finish of salt-tinged sweetness. Aged 2 years, 6 months in full-size charred oak.",60.0,86,52.0,3.0
2449,Dave Broom,"Distilled in 2009, so remember this is only 5 years old. At this stage there’s not a lot of cask, but there is an insanely intense smoky, herbal note like eucalyptus, celery, spruce, pine resin, then some angelica and a crisp mineral edge. The palate is balanced between this intensity, big smoke, and Bruichladdich’s typical oily, sweet core. Water doesn’t affect it one little bit. It is bold, it is proud, it is in charge. I like its sheer ballsiness. £110",168.0,86,59.1,1.0
2450,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"This whiskey portrays its coastal origin with a lovely sea-air quality that vies for attention with brown sugar, beeswax, and delicate smoke notes. Gentle peatiness weaves through the cocoa-tinged honeyed malt on the palate, culminating in a smoldering finish, where the mouthwatering saltiness seals the deal. Nicely integrated and well balanced, with fine pot still character. A single malt of pale and peated malts, aged 7 years in bourbon barrels.",45.0,86,45.0,3.0
2452,Fred Minnick,"Straw color and extremely light in aromatics, this whiskey starts earthy and goes spicy, with Hatch chili, allspice, and jalapeño cornbread leading the way. Then the sweeter side kicks in, with powdered sugar donuts, caramel chew, and vanilla latte coming through. Spice takes over toward the finish line in a hefty, medium finish. Perfect for cocktails. Price is per 375 ml.",50.0,86,52.0,2.0
2454,Gavin Smith,"Matured for 6 to 8 years in bourbon casks before finishing in sherry casks. The early nose is earthy, with dough balls, then sweeter sherry notes emerge, with ripe tangerines and honey. Sweet sherry fills the full palate with black pepper and developing raisins. Plain chocolate, black pepper, and aniseed in the relatively long finish. Distillery not disclosed.",29.0,86,40.0,1.0
2457,John Hansell,"A new wheated bourbon from Heaven Hill, using wheat instead of rye in the mashbill, resulting in a smooth, easygoing whiskey. Layers of sweetness (creamy vanilla, maple syrup, marzipan) combine with blackberry jam and cinnamon. Gentle polished oak on the finish adds drying balance to the sweet notes. Nicely done and reasonably priced!",25.0,86,46.0,2.0
2458,Fred Minnick,"Cotton candy, caramel, baked apples, roasted pecans, freshly baked rye rolls, and herbs start a truly approachable pour. Its story opens in a spice race: cinnamon, nutmeg, turmeric, and smoked paprika and a slight hint of coffee. A burst of dill hits, just before vanilla walks it home to a lovely, medium finish. An interesting sipper, but remarkable in cocktails.",45.0,86,47.0,2.0
2459,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Initially restrained; as the nose opens up it reveals plum, red berry fruit, pine resin, and root-beer spices. The palate picks up a bit, slightly vinous in its red-fruit drive, herbal-cherry cough drop, and sweet vanilla, leading to a modest finish laced with licorice, cinnamon, and pine forest.",50.0,86,44.0,
2461,Fred Minnick,"Quite an unusual start: melted butter poured over brown rice followed by caramel, vanilla, and fried sweet potatoes. Although the ABV suggests it’s light, the body actually holds up quite well with notes of banana, quince, marzipan, bread pudding, and vanilla. Alas, the short finish doesn’t follow suit, only offering a hint of caramel.",25.0,86,40.0,2.0
2462,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Starts off sweet, followed by nutmeg, cinnamon, clean oak, and a zesty bitterness. This austere yet elegant whisky slowly develops a deep complexity. Silky corn and bourbon-like vanilla toffee override distinct suggestions of apple juice, as dusty rye along with hints of dry grass lead into mashy cereal notes. Finishes with tightly integrated flavors of white pepper, gingery spices, hints of fresh-cut wood, and hot peppermint. Lovely. (Canada only) C$37",37.0,85,40.0,4.0
2463,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The warehouses at Glenora are not heated, so aging virtually stops in winter. Thus, the whisky doesn’t reach its peak until its mid-teens. By then, it is malty, fresh, crisp, and grassy, with hints of vanilla and delicate, slightly bitter fruits, including apricots and citrus pith. Fragile floral notes join exotic hints of mango and a nuttiness reminiscent of almond skins and sweetened coconut. Air do dheag slàinte, Glenora, as they say in Cape Breton’s Gaelic Highlands. (Canada only)",101.0,85,43.0,
2464,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Beginning with dried orange peels and steely rye that smells like a creek bed, the nose slowly develops light fruit, caramel, and vanilla fudge. Finally, pears, sweet plums, and raspberries emerge. On the palate, Midnight erupts into glowing hot spices, citrusy sweetness, dark fruits, candied ginger, and mildly grassy prairie sage. The heat and sweetness build into plummy sweet and sour sauce with vague hints of barrel notes. The long finish is unusually spicy.",35.0,85,45.0,4.0
2469,Dave Broom,"The decline in the Spanish market has resulted in Cardhu becoming more widely available, which is A Good Thing as far as I am concerned. This is a grassy malt, which at 12 years also has a heightened citric spray of sweet orange zest and a gingery aspect (it’s great with ginger ale). Intense and vibrant with macadamia and a light heathery note, the palate confounds expectations, having a thick chewiness before the grass zings through, adding lift.",45.0,85,45.0,1.0
2479,John Hansell,"A pleasing, very drinkable bourbon. Elegant notes of butterscotch candy, honey-tinged fruit, creamy vanilla, and sweet corn, with delicate mint on the finish.

2480,John Hansell,"Amber color. Aroma of soft fruit, sweet corn, caramel, light toffee, and a hint of mint. Light to medium in body, and smooth. On the palate, notes of caramel coated fruit, corn and delicate toffee notes, becoming gently dry, with notes of vanilla and mint.",25.0,85,43.3,2.0
2481,John Hansell,"This might the most drinkable Evan Williams Single Barrel vintage ever produced. Its most noticeable personality trait is sweetness (gentle, not cloying), with notes of caramel corn, vanilla custard, candied fruit, and subtle macaroon. Spearmint, cinnamon, nutmeg, and charcoal provide some zest. Soft and clean on the finish, with gentle oak resin. A smooth, easy ride from beginning to end.",26.0,85,43.3,2.0
2483,John Hansell,"A great value. Fully matured and very civilized. Good enough to drink neat, yet inexpensive enough to use as a mixer.

2486,John Hansell,"The whiskey’s formula has been improved, and now consists of a higher percentage of older whiskies (into the high teens) than the original release (which I rated 81).

2487,John Hansell,"This Jefferson’s bourbon spent most of its life (almost four years) on a boat in the ocean. All that rocking and environmental conditioning has this whisky tasting four to five times its age. Yes, there’s plenty of resinous oak and leather, but there are also balancing notes of molasses, treacle, toffee, old demerara rum, and roasted nuts. A peppering of cinnamon, mint, tobacco, and maybe…yes, brine add intrigue.",90.0,85,44.0,2.0
2488,John Hansell,"A thick, heavyweight bourbon. Older doesn’t always taste older, and this 30 year old Jefferson’s tastes younger than its sibling 25 year old. The influence of 30 years in oak is evident with its polished leather, tobacco, and charred oak. However, there’s a surprising sweetness that props up the oak with maple syrup, blackberry jam, cinnamon roll, and vanilla cream. Very even-keeled. Yes, it tastes old, but with redeeming qualities. Dark and mysterious in personality.",250.0,85,45.2,2.0
2489,John Hansell,"Honeyed citrus, vanilla, and hints of toasted coconut on the nose.  Similar follow-through on the palate—sweeter up front and then becoming dry with firm spice and toasted nuts. Long, resinous, warm spice finish.  I’d like a little less dried spice on the finish—or more sweetness to balance it. Otherwise, a nice bourbon.",50.0,85,48.5,2.0
2490,John Hansell,"This whiskey’s signature over the last several years has been wood dominant, with plenty of dried spice (the exception being the 2013 release which I really enjoyed—it was chock full of balancing sweetness). The 2014 release is similar to the pre-2013 releases, with dried spice (cinnamon, vanilla) and dried citrus on a soft bed of maple syrup, caramel, and honey, leading to resinous oak grip on the finish. A dynamic bourbon, but still leaning heavily on the oak spice.",60.0,85,48.5,2.0
2491,John Hansell,"The first release in the “Whiskey Row” series. Nicely balanced flavors with a youthful kick. Fairly straightforward in profile, with plenty of spice (cinnamon, clove, mint, and nutmeg), citrus fruit (orange, tangerine, grapefruit), and honey vanilla. Dry, spicy finish. A little rough around the edges, but otherwise an enjoyable whiskey.",45.0,85,45.0,2.0
2492,John Hansell,"Ardmore whiskies I’ve enjoyed in the past have been soothingly malty. Many have also been recognizably smoky, which is rare for a Speyside whisky. This one, aged in a first fill bourbon barrel, is true to its roots. It is a clean whisky, with a creamy, soothing maltiness throughout. The palate is entertained by notes of vanilla and honey, with anise, white pepper and a teasing smokiness. The thick maltiness and soft smokiness linger long on the finish. A very underrated whisky.",65.0,85,,1.0
2493,John Hansell,"Predominantly fruity -- the sherry cask is obvious, but it’s not heavy or dominant. Clean, bright orchard fruit blends in nicely with strawberry rhubarb pie, light toffee, dates, dark chocolate, and polished oak. Long, soothing, oily finish. Another solid effort from this young distillery.",80.0,85,56.6,1.0
2494,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in February 2000 and matured in a single refill hogshead, this example of Arran is part of the Provenance range which highlights the season of distillation on the bottle label. Malt, salt, milk chocolate, vanilla, and developing citrus notes on the fragrant nose. Quite full in the mouth, fruity and zesty, with a hint of grist. Long and softly spiced in the finish, with almonds and a final suggestion of aniseed. £40",63.0,85,46.0,1.0
2495,Gavin Smith,"Isle of Arran Distillers has introduced a second edition of its Orkney Bere expression, made with an ancient variety of barley still cultivated in the Orkney Islands and aged in bourbon barrels. It is a cask strength 10 year old variant, and 4,890 bottles are available. The nose is quite oily, with ripe peaches and pineapple cubes, plus developing floral notes. Viscous and sweet on the palate, with tangerines, caramel, and rich spices. The finish is lengthy, with coconut and milk chocolate-coated caramel.",95.0,85,56.2,1.0
2496,John Hansell,"Color is antique gold while the aroma is dry but creamy, with notes of vanilla, marshmallow, honey, and tropical fruit (pineapple, coconut). Palate is malty and creamy up front, with vanilla, marshmallow, and a hint of honey; briefly becoming fruity (again, the tropical fruits) before turning dry and oaky, with a big, long, dry finish (especially for a triple-distilled Lowlander). Lowland whiskies are known for maturing nicely at a younger age. But most people don't know that some (especially Auchentoshan) are delicious at older ages too. As mentioned in my 'From the Stills' column, older vintages of Auchentoshan are now only being offered to individual retailers, one cask at a time, and this is one of those casks. It is one of many 1966 vintage Auchentoshan whiskies I have enjoyed over the past 15 years. Auchentoshan, from a balance and complexity perspective, seems to be best in the 20-30 year old range. Still, having said this, this one holds up fairly well for its age. Available exclusively at Park Avenue Liquors.",150.0,85,48.1,1.0
2497,Gavin Smith,"This 1998 vintage triple distilled Lowland Auchentoshan has been matured in fino sherry casks, which are rarely used for Scotch whisky maturation. The nose presents violets in fresh soil, honey, spice, developing citric fruit notes, and almonds. Quite full-bodied, fruity and zesty in the mouth. Lengthy in the finish, with spice, nuts, and oak. Becoming dry and gingery at the last.",70.0,85,54.6,1.0
2498,Gavin Smith,"Auchentoshan Valinch is essentially a cask strength version of the popular Classic expression. It is named after the metal tube used to extract samples of spirit from the cask.

2500,Gavin Smith,"This is the second edition of Auchentoshan’s cask strength Valinch bottling, which carries no age statement and has been matured in first-fill bourbon casks. As with the previous Valinch expression, only 2,000 cases have been released globally. Very fragrant on the nose, with pears, applesauce, and vanilla fudge. Spice, cream, and lively Jaffa oranges on the palate. A touch of (not unpleasant) new make spirit comes through in the relatively lengthy finish.",60.0,85,57.2,1.0
2501,Gavin Smith,"Batch 2 runs to 295 bottles and, in common with the rest of the range, carries no age statement. Peaches in brandy, ginger, honey, and milk chocolate on the pleasingly floral nose.

2502,Gavin Smith,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, this expression of Auchentoshan was aged for 14 years in a mix of bourbon and oloroso sherry casks. It is not chill-filtered prior to bottling. The nose yields polished oak, malt, milk chocolate, marzipan, figs, apricots, and ginger. Rich and full on the palate, spicy, with vanilla, mango, and finally Seville oranges. Medium to long in the finish, with almonds, soft oak, and warming spices.",100.0,85,46.0,1.0
2503,Gavin Smith,"A non-chill filtered bottling matured in a mixture of bourbon and red wine casks. The nose offers a big early orange hit, vanilla, and red wine notes.

2504,John Hansell,"Here’s the older sibling to the 1997 vintage released in U.S. at the same time. It costs twice as much as the 1997 vintage, and guess what? I like the less expensive 1997 vintage better (because of its lovely balance and creamy texture). Still, this 1991 vintage is a nice whisky, rich with vanilla, coconut cream, citrus (orange, tangerine), pineapple, and sultana. A soothing, mouth-coating texture lingers, with some polished oak on the finish.",130.0,85,43.0,1.0
2505,Gavin Smith,"Balblair has released two Travel Retail-exclusive variants of its 2004 vintage, matured in bourbon barrels and sherry casks respectively. The Sherry Matured version was aged in American and Spanish oak sherry butts. It is only available in Asia. Oriental spices, soft leather, and damsons on the nose. Milk chocolate-coated Turkish delight in time. The palate features lively spices, cooking apples, vanilla, medium-sweet sherry, and hazelnuts. Spices persist in the finish, with honey and raisins.",83.0,85,46.0,1.0
2506,Gavin Smith,"This Balblair vintage replaced the previous 1997 bottling, and maturation took place in a mix of bourbon barrels and sherry butts.

A medium to long finish, spicy, with slight oakiness.",90.0,85,46.0,1.0
2507,John Hansell,"The newest release in Balvenie’s limited edition range, and the first venture back into smoke since the “Islay Cask” limited release several years ago. Some of this whisky was finished in a peated cask, some in new American oak. Both influences emerge with the smoke (jerky with a hint of kippers) and spice (cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg) on a foundation of honeyed malt. Spicy, smoky finish. Balvenie is one of those big Speyside whiskies that can stand up to the smoke. This one will not appeal to everyone, but it makes for an interesting diversion.",130.0,85,43.0,1.0
2508,Dave Broom,"Here, the distillery character is more restrained, as if it is taking a period of calm reflection before the next evolution. There’s slightly more maltiness here and the texture has changed into a light acacia honey stickiness and a development of more oxidized notes, showing a gentle maturation. It’s one I kept going back to; teasing, slightly elusive, but rewarding. £1,300",,85,54.1,1.0
2509,Gavin Smith,"An attempt to replicate the spirit produced at Ben Nevis in 1882. The malt is peated to around 30 ppm, and a first edition of 700 bottles with no age statement has been released. Initial starch on the nose, then buttery smoked haddock, a hint of chili, sherry, and gentle wood smoke. Full-bodied, spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and peat. Stewed fruit and lingering spicy cigarette ash in the finish. £60",96.0,85,46.0,1.0
2510,John Hansell,"Sounds more like a disease than a whisky. A peated version of BenRiach, with the tarry smoke melding nicely with toffee, bramble, and rhubarb. Lingering earthy smoke on the finish and slightly tannic, with subtle fruit. Good mouthfeel on this one.",88.0,85,46.0,1.0
2511,John Hansell,"(Exclusive to Park Ave Liquors, New York, NY) A rich, clean, bright whisky, with aromas of honey, marshmallow, vanilla, and a mélange of fruit (orange, peaches, lemon, pineapple). Creamy in texture and richly flavored without being heavy or cloying. The various fruit notes dance on the palate and add complexity to the sweetness. Long, soothing finish. Great after dinner-given its considerable weight, but lively enough to have before dinner.",65.0,85,,1.0
2512,John Hansell,This one stands out from the other three because of its port wood finishing. Dark amber/ruby color. You’ll discover lush fruit and a rich nuttiness on top of the typical flavors expressed in the 18 year old. Additional layers of intense spice and oak notes balance the whisky’s sweetness and fruit. The heartiest of the bunch.,150.0,85,45.0,1.0
2513,Dave Broom,"A new member of the core range, this has a cinnamon spice nose with wood smoke elements that grow into hickory as it opens. There’s also sandalwood, citrus, and dried fruits. Medium-bodied and juicy, there’s light sherried notes on the tongue, alongside perky acidity, especially with water. The smoke has better integration on the palate, allowing tangerine and sultana to come through. G&M’s aim has always been to make a classic pre-60s Speysider, and that’s achieved here.",100.0,85,43.0,1.0
2514,Gavin Smith,"Following on from the official 8 year old release of Bladnoch, distilled and matured under the current Raymond Armstrong regime, comes a 9 year old variant in the familiar distillery label series. It offers a spring-like nose of cereal, freshly-squeezed lemon juice, meadow flowers, and a hint of milky coffee. Spicy toffee, apples, honey, and ginger on the palate, which finishes with a floral note, lemon, apples, and lively oak. £40",63.0,85,46.0,1.0
2515,Gavin Smith,"This 12 year old example of Diageo’s Perthshire single malt has been matured in a sherry butt and features milk chocolate, malt, and digestive biscuits on the nose; becoming fruitier, notably with lemon curd.

2516,John Hansell,"Every once in a while you get whisky where the palate is completely different than the nose. This is one of those whiskies. Aged in bourbon casks and 37 years old, its aroma expresses tropical fruits (similar to other older Bowmores), with papaya, lemon, mango, strawberry, coconut, and banana. This is balanced by vanilla, crème brûlée, honey, and just a wisp of smoke. Bowmore’s Islay roots are more expressive on the palate, which starts off sweet and slightly oily, quickly evolving to tropical fruit, damp oak, and then leafy smoke through to the finish. The sweetness emerges again towards the finish, with subtle brine and seaweed. (120 bottles for the U.S.)",1000.0,85,43.4,1.0
2517,John Hansell,"Amber color. Complex, exotic aromas of vanilla fudge, coconut, white chocolate, plum, cherry, citrus, and a hint of smoke and bourbon. Light to medium in body and delicate. On the palate, there’s a brief encounter of caramel and fruits mentioned above. After that, most of the flavors come from the wood-dry vanilla, mint, layered spicy oak notes, with some smoke emerging from time to time. Dry, oaky finish. 
Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: approx. $1,500. Available at specialty retailers nationwide May 2003.

2519,John Hansell,"Aged in a sherry cask, and the lush fruity notes add dimension and richness without masking the whisky’s other flavors. Its flavors are reminiscent of crumbled peat thrown over a campfire; damp earth, anise, and floral notes throughout, dovetailing with the lush sherried fruit. Smoky, briny finish. A well-rounded dram.",74.0,85,46.0,1.0
2520,Dave Broom,"This is quite a saline Bowmore, but there is sufficient sliced apple, cut flowers, and fragrant smoke to give some degree of complexity to the nose. With water you get crisp oak, roasted barley, a hint of nectarine, bison grass, and wet reeds. Starting lean in the mouth, it darkens slightly into brambles and a dusty smokiness before picking up a citric tang on the finish. Slightly muted, but well balanced. £60/500 ml",100.0,85,51.6,
2521,Dave Broom,"The mid-priced Fèis Ìle release took Bowmore off into darker than usual territory. The key here was how the cask (PX is, after all, as sweet a sherry as you can find) had been so well controlled. Rather than being a thick, sweet mess, a balance was struck between the two elements: the cask added density and raisined fruit, while the distillery gave aromatic smoke and orange, and both combine to layer on molasses, leather, and dark chocolate. A success. £100",130.0,85,56.1,1.0
2522,Gavin Smith,"The latest addition to Bowmore’s core range is presented at the unconventional age of 9 years. Matured predominantly in oloroso sherry casks, with some bourbon cask-aged spirit thrown into the mix. The result is a whisky featuring drinking chocolate, black pepper, and soft peat on the nose. Sherry and sweet peat notes merge nicely on the palate, with dates, plums, and light caramel. Smoky brine in the medium-length finish. £30",37.0,85,40.0,1.0
2523,John Hansell,"Quite fresh for 24 years old. Invigorating notes of brine, spice (especially pepper and mustard seed), tropical fruit, and vanilla malt, and an appetizing, lingering brine finish. Well-rounded, and a nice balance between youthful zing and maturity. My only wish is to see this bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered",250.0,85,43.0,1.0
2524,Dave Broom,"An interesting nose that’s somewhat akin to a peach cheesecake with slightly burnt pastry, or a heavily caramelized crème brûlée. Overt smoke is in check when neat. In the mouth, however, it comes through massively, mossy and oily and sitting on top of those fat fruits and sweet malt. Thicker and more farmyard-like than Port Charlotte. Great potential, with a sweetness that shows it’s pretty much there. £150",239.0,85,64.0,1.0
2525,John Hansell,"More mature peated Bunnahabhain Islay whiskies are emerging (like this one). Indeed, tarry, peat ash notes are evident throughout this one (especially on the finish!), along with nutty toffee, nougat, smoked olive, glazed ginger, and candied lime. Pretty even-keeled, not as medicinal and aggressive as its cousins on the southern end of the island. The smoke and layered sweet notes balance nicely. If you’re looking to ease your way into smoky Islay whiskies, this would be a good start.",88.0,85,46.0,1.0
2526,Dave Broom,"Pale gold, with nettles and green apple on the nose alongside almond, light bread crust, and freshly-baked sponge cake. In time, there’s Starburst sweets.

Clean and supple, especially with water. Zesty, with a refreshing acidic balance.",265.0,85,45.0,1.0
2527,Dave Broom,"This is master blender Ian MacMillan’s interpretation of what Bunna’ would have tasted like when the distillery was founded in 1881. There’s light smoke, coming across like smoked halibut, a mineral edge, white fruits, and a freshness like a freshly starched shirt. Water brings out almond. On the palate, the smoke offers a slightly peppery, almost Talisker-esque kick. Light lemon and sweet fruits in the center. Though there’s no age statement, none of the whiskies are under 10 years. £46",70.0,85,46.3,1.0
2528,John Hansell,"An unusual Caol Ila, in that it was finished in a rum cask. The rum influence is subtle - which I like - and it offers a new dimension to the whisky without blunting that Caol Ila character we have come to either love or (for some of you) despise. Olives, seaweed, fire smoke, salt and pepper notes are wrapped up nicely in a malty/caramel blanket. Peppery, smoky finish that lingers on like the embers of an all-night bonfire.",56.0,85,,1.0
2529,John Hansell,"Caol Ila enthusiasts will be familiar with the tarry rope, seaweed, brine, and white pepper. All this is underpinned nicely by soft, sweeter notes of dark chocolate and vanilla nut truffle. Subtle underlying juniper, horehound, and mint adds intrigue. Nice oily texture with a pleasing dry finish. Time has tempered this Caol Ila, but it has aged gracefully.",215.0,85,53.5,1.0
2530,John Hansell,"Light to medium in body (and quite pale in color), but quite invigorating. A flirtatious vanilla sweetness at the front of the palate quickly evolves into spicy, peppery, grassy notes. The whisky evolves further, expressing notes of smoke, tar, chewy seaweed, brine, feint green tea and olives. A persistent, if delicate, honey sweetness hangs on throughout to offer some gentility. Lingering, smoky finish. A raw whisky, but somehow compelling. An excellent value too! (Bottled exclusively for Binny's Beverage Depot.)",50.0,85,56.2,1.0
2531,John Hansell,"An interesting contrast to the Signatory bottling reviewed above. While expressing a similar fundamental flavor profile, this one is a more polished affair and not as daring. It is fuller in body, nicely rounded, and expresses a sweeter foundation (less honey, more toffee and caramel).",70.0,85,46.0,1.0
2532,John Hansell,"Sweet, viscous, and weighty; much more so than its sister whisky (reviewed above) that was finished in Madeira casks.

2534,Dave Broom,"Ahh, Clynelish. The enigma of the northeast coast. A single malt whose waxy character — and it does smell of snuffed candles — is highly prized by blenders. This is a palate whisky, the nose almost shy and muted: glints of citrus and jellied fruits, notes of ozone/spiciness and stem ginger. It’s on the tongue that it comes into its own: clinging, strangely savory, lightly sweet, juicily fruity. Enigmatic indeed.",53.0,85,43.0,1.0
2535,John Hansell,"Bright gold/straw color. Lively aroma of honey-drenched fruit (pineapple, red currant, citrus) with a rich malty foundation. Subtle floral notes in the background.

One of these experiments, aged entirely in a port cask, has finally been bottled. The nice thing about Glenfarclas is that it is a rich spirit and can stand up to a good dose of port wine (or sherry for that matter). The port notes are lush, with ripe fruit (plum, red grape skin, caramelized apricot, prune) and dates complementing the whisky’s malty, maple syrup foundation. The 27 years also impart a good dose of polished oak for balance. Not as complex as other Glenfarclas whiskies of this age, but this is certainly a solid, enjoyable change of pace for Glenfarclas.

Even neat it isn’t too hot, showing heft rather than bludgeoning power. In time there’s black cherry, chocolate, and a hint of smoke. Highly recommended.",80.0,85,60.0,1.0
2552,John Hansell,"(A Park Avenue Liquors exclusive). Shimmering gold color. Lovely creamy texture. This creaminess comes through in its flavors too, binding to notes of vanilla, malt, shortbread, and delicate honey. Floral notes, citrus, red currants, and a wisp of peat provide contrast. An enjoyable, nicely polished dram from a distillery whose whisky is underappreciated-especially the older expressions.",140.0,85,52.1,1.0
2553,Gavin Smith,"The latest release from Glen Garioch is a limited edition 1994 vintage, produced when the distillery still boasted working floor maltings, and is therefore more peaty than spirit subsequently distilled. Pear drops, vanilla, and developing caramel on the nose. Freshly-opened cigarette packets, and, in time, brown paper and vinegar. Quite dry and austere on the palate, with stem ginger and subtle smoke. Persistently spicy in the medium-length finish, with an elusive late flurry of smoky, chocolate caramel.",120.0,85,53.9,1.0
2554,Gavin Smith,"The first Glen Garioch vintage to be exclusive to Travel Retail outlets and also the only one so far to post-date the closure of  their on-site floor maltings. This leads to a less peaty note in the spirit than in other vintages. Matured in first and second-fill bourbon casks. Tinned peaches in syrup and nougat on the nose. Sweet malt, heather honey, vanilla, restrained cinnamon, nutmeg, and ginger on the palate. Subtle oak notes in the lengthy finish. £50",78.0,85,56.7,1.0
2555,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in September 1995 and matured for 17 years in a refill hogshead, this bottling of the Aberdeenshire malt Glen Garioch
offers a nose of fresh peaches and vanilla, followed by a sprinkling of chili powder, and even a suggestion of boiled ham. Voluptuous in the mouth, with summer fruits, toffee apples, and a significant amount of ginger. The finish
dries quite rapidly, with fruity spices. £60",92.0,85,46.0,1.0
2556,Gavin Smith,"The Aberdeenshire distillery of Glen Garioch has released its first ever virgin oak-matured expression, which has employed heavily charred American oak barrels. According to master blender Rachel Barrie, “Glen Garioch’s intense flavor means it holds up well in a new fill cask.” Ripe peaches on the nose, spicy oak, vanilla, and more soft, floral notes in time. Malt, milk chocolate, nectarines, nougat, and mild cloves on the palate, while the finish is medium in length, with ginger and lively oak.",120.0,85,48.0,1.0
2557,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A 15 year malt selected by the Loch & K(e)y Society. Hard apple cider leads the nose and is backed by honeyed malt and cinnamon-baked pear. The entry is lush caramel apple, but quickly transitions as the sheer power and spice of the mid-palate comes crashing in with oak, ginger, and pine. The finish is long, dry, and spicy with lingering heat. This is the kind of big, bold, dry whisky that American whiskey drinkers might enjoy. (Julio’s Liquors only)",115.0,85,56.1,1.0
2558,Gavin Smith,"The entry level, no age statement expression of Glen Garioch, offered at an unusually high ABV for a single malt in this price range.  Grapefruit , lively spice, vanilla, malt, and black pepper on the nose. Milk chocolate, chili, cooking apples, and something slightly savory on the palate. Citrus fruits and lots of spice in the relatively lengthy finish. An unusual and pleasing dram for the money. £32",46.0,85,48.0,1.0
2559,Gavin Smith,"Torfa is apparently Old Norse for “turf” or “peat,” and this no age statement Glenglassaugh was made using malt peated to around 20 ppm phenols. Heathery peatiness on the early nose, with dried fruits, malt, and cream soda. Ultimately, leathery, mellow smoke. Sweet and lively on the palate, after an initial flavor of coal soot, with ripe peaches, chili, and ginger, backed by floral peat and a hint of ozone. Spicy peat smoke in the relatively long and fruity finish. £40",67.0,85,40.0,1.0
2560,John Hansell,"Deep gold color. Aromas of creamy vanilla, herbs, wood spice, and subtle fruit. Light and creamy in body. On the palate, this whisky starts out clean and sweet, with notes of vanilla and honey. It then turns dry with spicy, herbal, soft fruity notes, finishing on the dry side.",65.0,85,43.0,1.0
2561,Gavin Smith,"Glengoyne’s entry-level 10 year old is the most readily available of their malts, and is made using entirely unpeated malt. The producers claim this helps to preserve “the essence of its flavor.” Fresh and well-rounded on the nose, with medium sweet aromas suggesting malt, oak, and a hint of sherry. Smooth and delicate on the palate, it is slightly oaky, with a suggestion of cooking apples. The finish is pleasingly long, with buttery, vanilla notes, slowly drying.",40.0,85,40.0,1.0
2562,Gavin Smith,"Named in honor of the copper teapot from which distillery workers were ‘drammed’ until the 1970s, this distillery-exclusive bottling has been matured in first-fill oloroso sherry casks for an unspecified period. The nose is fruity and fragrant, with profound spicy sherry notes. Mouth-coating, with lots more sherry, plus prunes, drinking chocolate, and a little oak. Lingering in the finish, with drying sherry, light spice, and dark chocolate. A great dram for lovers of a true sherry monster! £60",92.0,85,59.4,
2563,Gavin Smith,"Bottled in 2014, this expression of Glenkinchie was distilled in 2000 and finished in amontillado sherry casks. The amontillado gives a more rounded feel and greater profundity to the single malt. Peaches, apricots, almonds, and soft ginger on the nose, Smooth and balanced on the palate, gently spiced and nutty, with cherries, caramel, discreet sherry, and vanilla. The medium-length finish features vanilla and lingering, spicy Jaffa oranges, drying slowly to oak. £63",92.0,85,43.0,1.0
2564,Dave Broom,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. This is from a first fill American oak hoggie, and the extra time in cask has given it a classic mature Glenlivet character: a rich, complex mix of cooked apple, pine, and citrus, cut with rose petal. The fruitiness has moved from pear into baked apricot. Water adds an almond note. The scented notes have been retained (especially on the finish), but have deepened into sweet spice. The oak gives light grip. Have with chilled water on the side. £250",410.0,85,48.5,1.0
2565,Dave Broom,"As with the ‘Fiddich (reviewed in this issue), here’s a malt where an improved wood policy has brought a dram to life and added complexity. The Glenlivet has always been about lightness, but the trick is to have sufficient solid base to allow its flower to blossom, so as well as lily, orchid, and pineapple, there’s a thick creaminess that gently beds all of these flighty flavors down. With water, there’s mandarin and rose petal, and a sneeze of white pepper. Simply lovely. Value Pick",33.0,85,40.0,1.0
2566,John Hansell,"A very fragrant, fruity whisky (orange, tangerine, plum, nectarine) with interwoven notes of honeyed malt, toasted oak, vanilla, and subtle anise. I love the creamy, mouth-coating texture of this whisky and its soothing finish. All the vintages of Glenrothes that have been released over the years are worthy of your hard-earned money, and this one is no exception. There's not as much depth as some of the older, more mature expressions, but the lively youthfulness of this whisky makes up for it.",55.0,85,,1.0
2567,John Hansell,"This 1984 Vintage is similar in profile to its older 1972 Vintage sibling (reviewed above), except that the 1972 Vintage expresses greater depth and has more oak to balance the sweetness (the sherry notes get a bit sappy in this 1984 expression). The 1972 Vintage also evolves more on the palate, and it is more intriguing. But don't let this keep you from trying this 1984 Vintage expression. It is still a very enjoyable whisky (and more economically priced).",83.0,85,43.0,1.0
2568,John Hansell,"One thing I enjoy about these vintage releases are the differences in personality from one vintage to the next. This 1998 vintage follows shortly after the 1994, and while that one was elegant and bright in personality, this 1998 is more viscous and heavier in weight. It shows bright fruit (lemon, caramelized pineapple, tangerine), honeyed vanilla, and marzipan with a peppering of cinnamon and ginger. Perhaps the 1994 as an aperitif, and the 1998 a digestif? The 1998 is not nearly as post-prandial as, say, the 1972 vintage, but it has more weight than the 1994 vintage. Still, if I had to choose between the 1994 and 1998, my nod goes to the 1994 for its elegance and drinkability.",55.0,85,43.0,1.0
2569,Dave Broom,"Bold, with a slightly blunt entrance. The cask influence is to the fore, mixing rum and raisin with a slight yeasty/dough-like edge that sits alongside caramelized fruits. In time, there’s sweet draff, malt loaf (with butter), and the smell of old cupboards. It gets creamier with water. Medium-bodied with a light savory note in the middle that then drifts toward Brazil nut, and Assam tea. A solid performer. Bristol Milk sherry rather than old oloroso. £55",88.0,85,40.0,1.0
2570,Gavin Smith,"This 10 year old expression from the Perthshire distillery of Glenturret has replaced the 12 year old. Glenturret is at the heart of The Famous Grouse blend, and the distillery was re-branded as ‘The Famous Grouse Experience’ in 2002. Nutty and slightly oily on the nose, with barley and citrus fruits. Sweet and honeyed on the full, fruity palate, with a balancing note of oak. Medium length in the sweet finish. £31 (Not available in the U.S.)",49.0,85,40.0,1.0
2571,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in September 1994 and bottled at 18 years of age as part of Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series, this Perthshire single malt displays a nose of malt loaf, tinned prunes, white pepper, and a suggestion of soy sauce on the nose. Finally, much more floral. Peppery on the palate, with citrus fruit, gunpowder tea, medium sherry, and cocoa powder. The powdery cocoa notes persist in the long, spicy, discreetly oaky finish.  £80",124.0,85,50.0,1.0
2572,Gavin Smith,"With only a 10 year old house bottling of Glenturret available, brand owners the Edrington Group have collaborated with independent bottler Hunter Laing to produce this ‘semi-official’ 26 year old expression, matured entirely in refill bourbon casks. Pineapple, dates, honey, and hard toffee on the floral nose. Full-bodied, waxy and chewy on the palate, with vanilla, ginger, cherry liqueur chocolates, and dark spices. Lengthy in the finish, with emerging bitter chocolate notes. £300",505.0,85,46.8,1.0
2573,John Hansell,"Aged initially in a refill sherry cask, and then in port casks. Layers of lush fruit (red raspberry, strawberry, currant, rhubarb, and ripe peach) with underlying toffee and pot still rum adding body and texture. Peat and brine peek through intermittently, particularly on the finish. The whisky is heavy on the fruit, but it is clean and not cloying. A very soothing whisky.",85.0,85,46.0,1.0
2574,Gavin Smith,"Unlike ‘house’ bottlings of Highland Park, all of which are aged in sherry casks, this expression in Douglas Laing’s Old Malt Cask series has been matured in former bourbon wood. It was distilled in September 1996. Sweet and fruity on the nose, with nougat and peanut butter, plus a slightly herbal note, and finally discreet, sweet peat smoke. Medium-bodied, citric, and spicy, with a little smoke. Smokiness turns to ash in the finish, with citrus fruit and caramel. £70",111.0,85,50.0,1.0
2575,Dave Broom,"Pale straw. One of a seemingly never-ending stream of Imperials from Duncan Taylor, all of which show remarkable consistency and are rarely over-wooded, thereby allowing the distillery character to shine. Here are echoes of Loire Sauvignon Blanc — nettles, gooseberry, cut grass, fennel tops, and fresh herbs — with a hint of Imperial’s giveaway American cream soda softness. The palate is as soft as soy milk. Classic Imperial.£38",60.0,85,,1.0
2576,Gavin Smith,"The name of this limited-edition bottling translates as ‘the lands around the rowan,’ and the component whisky has been matured in three, fresh-run American white oak hogsheads. Tinned peaches, a hint of smoke, and developing cream soda on the nose. Soft toffee and ultimately, chimney soot. The palate is full and fruity, with Brazil nuts, drying quite rapidly, with coriander notes. Dark chocolate and licorice characterize the finish. (500 bottles). £500",796.0,85,46.0,1.0
2577,Gavin Smith,"Exclusive to the Travel Retail arena, Jura Turas-Mara takes its name from the Gaelic for “long journey.” It has been matured in an array of casks sourced from America, Spain, France, and Portugal. Initially, green apples on the nose, then sweet fruit notes—jelly babies—plus coconut and fudge. A little linseed in the background. Vanilla, peaches, mango, and lively spices on the palate. The finish dries, with aniseed balls, becoming slightly powdery. €50",61.0,85,42.0,1.0
2578,Gavin Smith,"This Jura expression was distilled in 1984 and matured in bourbon casks for 22 years before a further 6 years in Gonzalez Byass Matusalem sherry butts and 2 years in Amoroso and Apostoles oloroso sherry casks. The nose opens with beef gravy, soon followed by prunes, cherries, dark chocolate, and PX sherry. Full-bodied, rich and sweet on the palate, with lively spices, and more cherries, and chocolate. Long and fruity in the finish, with spicy sherry and licorice. £750",1141.0,85,44.0,1.0
2579,Dave Broom,"Brought back as an annual limited edition to satisfy the cravings of those who like their peat full-on and never understood why Lagavulin moved to 16 years of age, this is the Kildalton coast single malt at its most boisterous. Aromatically, it blazes a seaweed-strewn, zigzag pathway between sea, shore, and land: bog myrtle and samphire, beach bonfire, sea spray, and melon before, with much-needed water, there’s slow-burning Latakia pipe tobacco and Lapsang Souchong tea.",103.0,85,57.5,1.0
2580,Dave Broom,"This is usually a bracing expression of Lagavulin and this year’s release doesn’t disappoint—smoldering peat, ozone freshness, but with greater sweetness than in 2011, though water shows how it is still just a little gawky. The palate is, yes, smoky, but there’s also light cereal, praline, violets, and seashore aromas aplenty. Fills the mouth with intensity. Okay, it’s edgy, but that’s what you expect.",111.0,85,56.1,1.0
2581,Dave Broom,"This is a venerable Lagavulin which immediately shows its age with a nose that mixes the savory (hoisin sauce) with the mature notes of dunnage warehouse, sandalwood, and a minty lift. In time, there’s bog myrtle, old attics, rain-moistened wool, and a smokiness akin to a dead briar pipe. Slightly dull to start, it perks up in the mid-palate with lanolin and black olive brine, and a Darjeeling-like grippiness. Interesting for sure, but past its best. (1,868 bottles).",,85,51.0,1.0
2582,Dave Broom,"Hard not to compare this to the 12 year old, as they are of similar strength and character. This is more about the peat bank rather than the shore, more eucalyptus than kelp. This pungent, earthy note is retained with water, alongside some brine. The palate is like carrageen moss pudding, with a touch of nutmeg at the end. Plenty there, but it all moves very quickly when I want it to linger. That said, a solid performer. £47/500 ml",78.0,85,55.7,1.0
2583,Dave Broom,"A very laid-back start with the sweetness of the sherry cask bringing a fat, figgy, dried fruit aroma which initially suppresses the peat, only allowing a little pipe smoke and smoked meat to emerge. With water, there’s balsam, tar, dried seaweed, and fabric Band-Aid. This is repeated on the tongue, with dark fruits suddenly changing to spent kiln and bonfire ashes, but there needs to be more cohesion between the elements. £80",135.0,85,48.0,1.0
2584,Dave Broom,"As pale as you'd expect, this year’s Special Release ‘limited’ bottling has a sweet, bready softness to it making it less angular than previous expressions. The smoke comes across very gently, allowing the sweet grassiness of the spirit the upper hand until water is added. The palate stirs in some emulsion paint, a pleasing lift of sulfur and anise, and gradually deepens. With water there are more smoke and marine notes.",135.0,85,56.8,1.0
2585,Gavin Smith,"This is the fourteenth 12 year old Lagavulin bottling in the series and was aged in refill American oak hogsheads. Vanilla and wood smoke on the early nose, then black pepper, lemon, marine aromas, and scented notes, with a hint of peaty yeast.

2586,John Hansell,"A nicely balanced Laphroaig, with a soothing malty sweetness layered in between the smoke, peat, tarry rope, and iodine. Underlying notes of vanilla bean, caramel custard, grist, anise, coconut, blueberry, and a dusting of cocoa add subtle complexity.",60.0,85,53.2,1.0
2587,Dave Broom,"Now you see it, now you don’t. Brought back like Frank Sinatra for last year’s 200th anniversary celebrations, here’s Laphroaig in gentle Islay sunset mode, all soft fruits and oils. There’s typical marine-like smokiness of course—particularly on the palate. I’d go neat with this to observe what is rather excellent balance.

2588,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in May 1993, this bottling is of the Ledaig heavily-peated variant of Tobermory single malt. Aged for 19 years, it was ‘finished’ for 40 months in wine casks from the St-Joseph AOC in northern Rhône. Pickled beetroot, emerging caramel, and distant log-fire embers on the nose. Voluptuous and fruity, notably spicy—pepper and ginger—plus mulled wine notes. Quite lengthy in the finish, with lingering spice. Peatiness is most evident here. 2,200 bottles.",110.0,85,45.0,1.0
2589,Gavin Smith,"This 18 year old variant of Ledaig from Tobermory distillery on Mull was released in spring 2015 and is finished in oloroso sherry casks.

2596,John Hansell,"Longmorn’s signature is a thick mouth-coating, honeyed maltiness, which is almost chewy in texture. While delicious in its teens, its personality lends itself to aging, because its maltiness provides a good counterpoint to the resinous dry oak notes which are usually imparted to older whiskies. This whisky is no exception. Notes of honey, vanilla malt, and subtle fruit dovetail nicely with the dry, resinous, polished leather-like contributions from 29 years in oak.

A foundation of honeyed malt, with background vanilla, subtle cocoa, faint bourbon, salt, and diffuse spice on the palate. Light to medium in body, but fairly viscous in texture. However, a coastal freshness cuts through the viscosity, keeping the whisky lively.

A whisky with a gentler personality when compared to most other island malts, making it a nice introduction to the style. I would, however, like to see this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered. I’d be more than willing to sacrifice some drinkability for greater intensity and more subtle nuances.

The flavors are slightly muted, but this is not surprising given its age. (A Park Avenue Liquors Exclusive.)",350.0,85,41.5,1.0
2613,Gavin Smith,"Named after a mythical hellhound that is said to stalk the area around Tomatin distillery, Cù Bòcan is lightly peated and matured in a combination of virgin oak, bourbon, and sherry casks. Just 60,000 liters are produced each year. Lemonade and coconut on the early nose, with developing almonds. Slightly earthy, with soft smoke. Rich, full mouthfeel, malt and honey, with the smoke more evident now, plus cinnamon and cloves. Nutty. Lingering oak and dry peat smoke in the finish.",70.0,85,46.0,1.0
2614,Gavin Smith,"The nose opens with savory notes. Richer, more fragrant and profound sherry than is present in the Fino or Manazanilla expressions.

2615,Gavin Smith,"Cù Bòcan is the lightly-peated variant of Tomatin single malt, and while most Cù Bòcan is matured in a combination of sherry, bourbon, and virgin oak casks, this expression was exclusively aged in virgin oak. Fragrant on the nose, with lemon, lanolin, vanilla, poached pears, and peppery rye notes. Rich spice and vanilla on the palate, zesty and warming, with apple pie, and caramel.

2616,Gavin Smith,"The latest vintage expression of Tomatin’s peated Cù Bòcan was aged in a mix of bourbon and sherry casks. Fishy smoke on the nose, with ripe red apples, toffee, milk chocolate, and malt. Creamy mouthfeel; ripe pears in peat smoke, sweet spices. White pepper, plain chocolate, and a lick of licorice in the relatively long and lively finish. (11,400 bottles)",65.0,85,50.0,1.0
2617,John Hansell,"This whisky starts with the light and very drinkable bourbon oak-aged 1993 vintage from previous years and then is finished off in a sherry cask. The sherry is fresh and vibrant, and adds lush fruit, light dates, and nutty undertone to Tullibardine’s classic vanilla, honeyed malt, and grassy notes. Delicious!",89.0,85,46.0,1.0
2618,John Hansell,"Similar in personality to its younger standard 1993 and 1992 vintages -- soft and mellow, with fresh barley, vanilla cream puff, cut grass and hay, cookie dough, and a dusting of pencil shavings. The extra aging shows on the whisky’s dried spice and polished oak finish. More sophisticated than its younger siblings, although the younger vintages are more drinkable.",99.0,85,46.0,1.0
2619,Gavin Smith,"Tullibardine Aged Oak Edition carries no age statement, though it contains a blend of whisky more than 15 years old and spirit produced since the distillery reopened in 2003. It has been matured in former bourbon barrels. The nose exhibits barley, citrus fruits, pear drops, crystallized ginger, marzipan, and cocoa. Oily in the mouth and slightly earthy, with brazil nuts and developing vanilla fudge and lemon on the palate. Fruitiness persists through the spicy finish.",45.0,85,46.0,1.0
2620,Gavin Smith,"The oldest expression in the Tullibardine lineup provides malt, cedar, stewed apples, and wood shavings on the nose. Mouth-coating, with orange and cocoa powder.

The finish is long, with cinnamon, licorice, and oak tannins.",75.0,85,56.1,1.0
2622,John Hansell,"Richer, thicker, and more lush than the 1975 vintage reviewed here. Fallen orchard fruit, sticky toffee pudding, and nuts, with underlying suggestions of date cake. Emerging dried spice and oak resin towards the finish. A good contrast to the 1975 vintage.",80.0,85,43.0,
2623,Gavin Smith,"This vintage edition of Oban was distilled in 1999 and finished in montilla fino sherry casks, which lend a greater richness and complexity to the Oban house style without detracting from its essential characteristics. It was bottled in 2014. The nose is fragrant, with musky pineapple, and salted caramel. Silky on the palate, with Seville oranges, ginger nuts, and cloves, plus a faint suggestion of brine. Persistent orange and dry spice notes in the oaky, medium-length finish. £75",110.0,85,43.0,1.0
2625,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Traditionally, this release has been a showcase for the raw power and spice of both young and old rye. In this single barrel release, the spice and fire have been considerably tamed by deep caramel, vanilla, and sweet corn. The spice is still there, with oak, rye, and cinnamon, but is no longer the star. The proof shows up in the finish, which is long and quite dry. An understated expression of one of High West’s flagship releases. Sourced whiskey. (Drink Up New York only)",47.0,85,50.0,3.0
2630,John Hansell,"Not overly challenging. Stylish and very easy to embrace. I would introduce a new bourbon drinker to this kind of bourbon. Pleasingly sweet, with honeyed vanilla, graham cracker, candy corn, dates, and golden raisin. Subtle spice (cinnamon, mint, cocoa, and nutmeg), leading to a smooth, silky finish. I would love to see this at 45% ABV or even higher, as it comes across almost too soft. But for this price, I’m not complaining. A great value.",15.0,85,43.0,2.0
2631,Gavin Smith,"Produced at Tullibardine distillery in 1989, this ex-bourbon hogshead has yielded 299 bottles.

2635,Gavin Smith,"One of four Spring 2013 single cask releases from Wemyss Malts, Fruit Bonbons was distilled at Glen Garioch in 1989 and bottled during 2012. The out-turn was 325 bottles.

2643,Lew Bryson,"Nose is much more integrated than the others; caramel and light honey tones with an oaky vein. After four CCs that were sequentially innocent, clumsy, eager, and balanced, this one is confident: well-rounded, sweet but not goopy, oaked but not prickly.

2644,Davin de Kergommeaux,"In the 1980s, when white spirits elbowed whisky aside in the marketplace, unneeded barrels of Canadian Club continued aging. Japanese whisky lovers delighted by the resulting flavor boost demanded a new Japan-only CC. Sweet and hot, the classic pruney, figgy fruitiness of Canadian Club interweaves with new cedar fence posts. Vaguely pulling tannins lend a bitter edge that first amplifies blistering hot pepper, then muffles it into the soothing, glowing warmth of bubbly ginger ale. (Japan only) ¥ 3,375",33.0,85,40.0,4.0
2646,John Hansell,"Still in the same vein as its 17 year old sibling reviewed above, but it’s softer, mellower, with more wood impact (especially on the nose and back end of the palate) and tea leaves. Perhaps even some mild tobacco. Darker sugars in this one (molasses?) rather than honey, and more berried fruit along with the citrus, which struggles to reveal itself. Dry, resinous finish. An enjoyable dram, even if the wood outstays its welcome. But if you have to pick between the two expressions, go for the 17 year old and pocket the change with a smile on your face.

2647,John Hansell,"This young distillery’s fourth release, aged entirely in bourbon barrels. (This is the first one available in the U.S.) The two previous releases that I tasted and reviewed (the inaugural release and the Autumn 2009 release) were finished in sherry casks. I miss the sherry, to be honest. I think it softened the whisky, added a new dimension, and perhaps even masked some of the youth. Still, this is a very nice effort: brisk, vibrant, and bracing, with plenty of raw peat smoke and tar, along with pear, citrus, vanilla, licorice root, bourbon barrel char, clove, bitter chocolate, and suggestions of olive brine and high-end mescal.",70.0,85,46.0,1.0
2648,Dave Broom,"The annual (albeit limited) Loch Gorm release allows you to chart Kilchoman’s development in sherry casks. Here, first-fill and refill sherry casks (oloroso to be precise) were used. The latter seem to have more of a say, as the distillery character is more apparent: sweet fruit, marine smoke, and clementine, before the golden raisin from the cask develops. The palate is smokier and also more overtly sherried. A bolder style, but very well balanced. Limited, so get in there ASAP.",100.0,85,46.0,1.0

2652,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Bright and lively, with violets, plenty of fresh oak, and traces of mint and pine, leading to a palate of butterscotch, bright citrus, warming spice, and sweet vanilla with drying and dusty cocoa. There is a glimmer of youth, expected given that 20% of this blend is their own distillery-made rye, aged less than 2 years. It’s an exciting glimpse of what’s to come, but the younger rye does little to enhance the great stuff they’ve been sourcing.",90.0,85,43.0,3.0
2657,John Hansell,"Quite the antithesis of the Signature Craft 12 year old, released at the same time. This one is finished in Spanish brandy barrels, so I expect it to be a polarizing whiskey. The brandy influence shows, with sweet fruit (sultana, honeyed tangerine, pineapple, ripe apricot) and spice (vanilla, cinnamon, ginger) interwoven with caramel. No age statement. Youthful, but not immature. A limited edition release.",40.0,85,43.0,2.0
2663,Dave Broom,"Pale, with fresh perfumed/fragrant estery notes that touch on flower blossom, almond icing on a custard cake, and even a little candy floss.

2668,Lew Bryson,"Wheats have a fruitier nose than bourbons, it seems, and this is no exception. Gentle, almost delicate fruits on the nose: white grapes, honeydew melon, baked apple.

Such a friendly whiskey.",40.0,85,45.0,3.0
2669,Dave Broom,"Okay, how many of you have walked past this one thinking the price is just too crazily low for the liquid to be any good? How many have started your whisky life with this and then set it aside? Time to rethink. Speyburn, one of the forgotten distilleries of Rothes, is a charmer. Sweet and fragrant with notes of blossom and a little red fruit on the nose, the palate shows ginger, cream, and rhubarb. (Value Pick)",25.0,85,40.0,1.0
2670,Lew Bryson,"Warm, delicate vapors curl from the glass: dry grain, sweet orange peel, honey candy, but all of it ethereally light. Quick in the mouth, makes other whiskeys seem heavy with wood. Sweet grain is the base of the structure, with a skin of soft citrus candy and custard notes. Wood is mostly present as a lightweight frame, almost like a zeppelin framework containing delicate volumes of flavor. This is craft, charting a new course.",65.0,85,46.0,
2673,John Hansell,"The second 20 year old single barrel release, sold at Heaven Hill’s Bourbon Heritage Center. (I rated the first one a 96.)

But some fairly aggressive, tactile oak on the finish keeps this whiskey from earning a higher rating.",150.0,85,45.0,2.0
2674,Lew Bryson,"Sourced whiskey, selected then finished by Big Bottom in Zin casks at their Oregon warehouse. Ruby glint to the whiskey, and a big, sweet, hot nose with a wine-side fruity slant to it. Wine’s more apparent
on the palate; there’s a bit of oak bite and red wine tang heating up the bourbon, which is broad, without obvious corn. The corn appears in the finish, which is firm and gripping. The Zinfandel finish is well-played here.",35.0,85,45.5,3.0
2675,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Big Bottom has made their name finishing sourced whiskeys. Now they’re experimenting with a blend of undisclosed whiskeys in a bourbon base. The result is a riff on Canadian-style whisky. Dark gold in color, the nose is light oak, caramel, cinnamon, and cherry. On the palate it’s a pleasant mix of creamy vanilla, oak, and cinnamon. A medium finish features light charred oak and black pepper spice. A unique approach to the style, one that manages to really work.",30.0,85,45.5,3.0
2676,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Fruity with dried dates and figs, peaches, peach pits, purple plum pits, and hints of black licorice. Tingling cloves and ginger add zip to traces of bitter chewing tobacco. Powerful, firm, and drying with pulling tannins like a fine Bordeaux. While this is gorgeous whisky in its own right, the French oak flavors have overwhelmed the familiar clean, spicy, fruity base of the original Masterson’s on which it was built.

2677,Lew Bryson,"Another MGP/LDI-sourced whiskey: but New Holland finishes it in oak barrels that they’ve used to age their Dragon’s Milk imperial stout, an interesting reversal of the bourbon barrel-aged beers brewers are making. It gives a dark wood nose with cinnamon and hot fruit. The whiskey’s a bit light in the mouth but enticingly smooth, a flow of corn, wood, and anise that flares up at the finish in a nice rush of heat. Quite good…but not great.",30.0,85,40.0,3.0

2680,Lew Bryson,"Maryland, Monongahela, and, I guess, Modern are the American rye styles. Maryland was a gentler rye, less spicy, and not as hot/sweet as modern rye. This has the dry-grass spice of rye, a hint of cocoa powder, and a bit of funk that blows away to hints of fruit. Light and clean on the palate, some sweetness that rapidly dries out in a grassy, herbal wave. Intriguing, without being overwhelming.",44.0,85,43.0,3.0
2685,John Hansell,"Single barrel, and not chill-filtered. Notably spicy (especially cinnamon) and gripping on the palate — the ten years in oak are not lost here. Some botanical notes too, especially toward the finish. Somewhat aggressive, but underlying notes of caramel, candy corn, and ripe tangerine help soften the blow. Despite its slightly imposing personality, it shows character and never steps over the line. (A Julio’s Liquors exclusive.)",32.0,85,50.0,2.0
2686,Lew Bryson,"Well-named: hops aroma comes flying right out of the glass — green pine and light peppermint — along with hot, sweet booze, but it’s a very clean scent, not feinty or heavy. The whiskey itself is quite light, not overbearing, and sweet with more pine and mint, along with a very pure malt character and a light touch of oaky vanilla. This is IPA booze, a rain-pure version, and more barrel could ruin it. Great gateway whiskey for a beer geek.",50.0,85,46.0,3.0
2687,Lew Bryson,"A “mesquite smoked Texas single malt whiskey,” this is a distillation of Ranger Creek’s Mesquite Smoked Porter. If you’re expecting to get shot out of the saddle, surprise: the aroma is quite delicate, with light mesquite, malt, melon, and butterscotch. The mesquite strikes first in the mouth—ashy, drying, a bit medicinal—followed by the cooler, sweeter malt and melon, and a hint of the chocolate malts in the porter. Another good young (6 months) whiskey from Ranger Creek. Price is per 375ml.",35.0,85,43.0,3.0
2688,Lew Bryson,"A new Small Caliber Series bottling, distilled from 100% rye. Nose gives rye dough, mint candies, and a push of rye oil and crushed grass. Punchy and perky on the tongue, hot and spicy young rye character with black pepper and bitter rye slicing through a sweet body; quite dynamic. Ranger Creek makes exciting whiskeys, for sure, and this one shows an increasing talent for balance. Price is per 375 ml.",35.0,85,47.0,3.0
2689,Lew Bryson,"Oddly smoky nose that grows on you — this is blue corn smoked with Texas scrub oak — you can smell burnt oak and light wreathings of corn. The first jolt is jalapeño without the heat, followed by a cornbread rush with a very light riff of smoke. The smoke builds to the finish and curls nicely around the corn. A very different whiskey experience; one I could get to like (could I try some with a plate of brisket?).",74.0,85,53.0,3.0
2690,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Very aromatic and pretty, with floral lilac, violet, and rosewater notes that follow through on the palate like a grandmother’s kiss.

Perhaps not for everyone, but this shows another thoroughly enjoyable side of rye whiskey.",60.0,85,47.5,
2691,Lew Bryson,"Sweet corn and dried cherries on the nose; pleasantly, quirkily intense. The palate is clean, sweet with corn and a hint of those cherries, framed by oak, and leads to a finish with no surprises: corn, oak, and a slight clench of heat. It’s almost predictable: there are no real flaws, but there’s no greatness, either. Still, solid delivery is a good thing. (sourced whiskey) —LB",25.0,85,43.0,3.0
2693,Lew Bryson,"There’s that 95% rye mashbill that tags this as an LDI-sourced rye…but it’s been finished in French oak white wine barrels. Pepper, warm ripe red plum, sweet vanilla, and a slice of nougat make for a sweet and urgent nose. The rye blows up in the mouth, lots more peppery spice, some flashy mint, and a thin, honeyed sweetness that hints at the nougat. Finish is a bit clingy, but a nice young rye with an interesting difference. (sourced whiskey)",42.0,85,45.0,3.0
2694,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"An intriguing whiskey, this smells like a flat, warm beer that was so good you still want to drink it the next day. Triple distilled from Samuel Adams Boston Lager, the hop notes are quite identifiable and really work well, imparting citrus, pine, and floral aromas. The palate is medium-bodied, with marshmallow sweetness, stone fruits, guava, and passion fruit, sprinkled with sea salt. Unusual, yet delicate, lively, and almost refreshing.",120.0,85,43.0,3.0
2695,Lew Bryson,"Still Waters blends sourced whiskey with under 9.09% of their own young spirit as top dressing (hence the name; it’s one part in eleven). Sweet cereal, honey, and flowers on the nose, which become much more authoritative in the mouth. Still sweet, but with a firm thump on the tongue, hot thin honey, crushed flower petals, and a lively, welcome heat for 40%. Clean, cereal-honey finish.

2698,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Hugely floral and perfumed on the nose, with rose petals, violet candies, and dried orange peel. This is the Gewürztraminer of American single malts—sweet lychee, laced with sachet aromas that explode as if opening Grandma’s dresser drawer.

2702,Gavin Smith,"That Boutique-y Whisky Company is an independent bottler noted for quirky and very contemporary label design. The whiskies carry no age statements. Springbank Batch 2 has an outturn of 450 numbered bottles. Initially, overripe pineapples and dry hay on the oily nose, cut by a sprinkling of salt. Brittle toffee, and finally, hand-rolling tobacco. The palate is very fruity; more pineapple, plus peach, developing peat, plenty of spice, and more tobacco. The finish is relatively long and slightly herbal. £58",89.0,85,53.1,

The treacle-thick palate has Coca-Cola, clove, aniseed, eucalyptus, sultanas, leather, blackcurrant, black cherry, dried fig, and raisin. The currant-bun finish is tannic and woody; tastebuds flinch and recoil. This is a grizzled old-timer best left to adventurous souls.",604.0,85,46.5,1.0
2708,Lew Bryson,"All-malt, double pot-distilled, aged 2 years in new, charred, 53 gallon oak barrels. Nose has cereal and muted apple notes, some light grassiness, youthful. Exciting on the palate: hard candy, vanilla, oaky spice, hints of maple; it’s a jubilance that doesn’t end, but doesn’t get tiresome like some sugar-high toddler either. Finish is just more of the same, which is okay, but mildly disappointing. Well done, but quite pricey. Price is per 375ml.",50.0,85,45.0,3.0

2717,Lew Bryson,"More pale than other crafts I usually see; the whiskey is 12 to 21 months old and spends time serially in wine casks, medium toast American oak barrels, and finally “very experienced” French oak. Smell is
quite young, but clean, with notes of orange and rye grain, and a whiff of nutty toffee. Quite a lively mouth, with much more toffee, less orange, a hint of odd spice (cardamom?), and a twist of milk chocolate at the finish. Interesting stuff.",32.0,85,40.0,3.0

The first nose is all fresh flaxseed before peppermint, anise, and sweet fragrant flowers waft in. A few minutes later the nose morphs into peach cobbler with lingering suggestions of dry grain. Cooked peaches sustain the palate until sweet spices arrive, bringing hints of oak and creamy barley sugar with them. There’s lots of action in this whisky glass.

This is malt whisky, held together by strong cereal notes with a fruity, creamy, medium finish. It’s already tasty at 3 years; one wonders what glories another 3 would bring.",70.0,85,46.0,4.0
2720,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Raising the bar a little higher, Still Waters is introducing Red Label, a blend that is rich in 100% rye, all-corn, and single malt whiskies. The undisclosed base whisky is sourced, the rest made in-house. Luscious with sweet esters, lilacs, white clover blossoms, oak sugars, vanilla, and a brace of warming spices. Round, mouth-filling, and creamy on the palate, and after a second, pleasing rye spices emerge. Hints of barrel notes with glowing pepper and citrus pith. Mix or sip. C$40",31.0,85,43.0,4.0
2721,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This 5 year old corn whisky is blended with mature rye and single malt, creating a soft and creamy dram with flickers of grain dust and smatterings of spice. Pleasantly hot with sweet spices and fruit market aromas. Very pleasant esters, hints of acetone and pepper, it fades into corn syrup and traces of cinnamon. More woodiness would raise the score. (Distillery-only bottling or by mail order in Ontario) Canada’s Sesquicentennial Celebratory Release. C$45",36.0,85,50.0,4.0
2723,Lew Bryson,"A wheater, 70/20/10 corn/wheat/malt, barrel proof, and 32 months old. A rich corn nose, with some wood notes and a slightly antiseptic sting of alcohol heat. Young in the mouth—cinnamon candy, a bit meaty—but all the right pieces are in place: warmth, corn, oak spice, and a smooth progression to the warm finish. Good already, and showing even more promise.",45.0,85,52.5,3.0
2724,Lew Bryson,"Here’s something interesting: all-malt, but not all barley malt, there’s some rye and wheat malt as well. The rye pokes through as fresh grassy notes, struggling with the young barrel character. Detonates on the palate: spice, fudge, vanilla, grain, and oak. This is brash, loud stuff, broad-shouldered, insistent, and cocky. Could find favor with the hophead clan of craft beer drinkers. You’d think it could use some taming, but given a chance, its boldness is appealing.",40.0,85,45.0,3.0
2725,Gavin Smith,"This Dalmore single cask variant was distilled in October 1996 and filled into a refill hogshead, which yielded 139 bottles in January 2014. Freshly-mown hay, then marzipan and nectarines on the well-spiced nose. Nutty caramel in time. The palate features Terry’s chocolate orange, vanilla, and nutmeg. Citrus fruits and malt in the finish, with hazelnuts and a hint of oak. £90",152.0,85,54.8,
2726,Dave Broom,"Dailuaine is a fascinating distillery and this has a fascinating nose, as it shows a heavy sulfury new make entering maturity and starting to pick up extra weight from the cask. There’s a glimpse of sweetness, a little fruit, but the dominant character is a savory meatiness (beef stock cubes). The palate shows dried mint and masses of this meaty/sweet interplay. Is it commercial? Probably not, but it tells a really important story. I like it a lot. £45",66.0,85,46.0,1.0
2727,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Most of Auchroisk's malt goes into Diageo’s J&B blended, so a single malt release is an uncommon treat. Aged in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a nutty, roasted malt nose. On the palate it’s soft and lush, with honeyed roasted malt, walnut, ginger, and salt. A spicy mid-palate leads to a dry finish that abandons a lot of the flavors established. A solid mix of flavors, but the finish shows why it's often used for blending. (U.S. only)",110.0,85,56.4,1.0
2729,Gavin Smith,"Offered in the ‘Distillery Labels’ series by Gordon & MacPhail, this expression from Wick’s Pulteney distillery hearkens back to the era when Gordon & MacPhail was its principal bottler, and 8 its standard age. Aged in refill bourbon barrels. Soft fruits, dried grass, and faint wood smoke on the nose. Smooth and nutty on the palate, with smoky spice, a sprinkling of salt, and ripe pears. The finish is medium in length, mildly peppered, nutty, and oaky.",45.0,85,40.0,1.0
2730,Gavin Smith,"Matured in refill bourbon barrels, this Tomatin is softly floral on the nose, with sweet fruit spices, pineapple, vanilla, and honey. The palate is fresh and fruity, with cream, milk chocolate, and nutty spice. Fruity to the end, notably ripe apples and red berries, plus more milk chocolate before slightly drying oak notes develop. £70",92.0,85,46.0,1.0
2731,Gavin Smith,"The nose is more reticent than that of its younger sibling, with less spice and succulent fruitiness. A hint of nougat, but overall, drier and ‘quieter.’ The palate is silky, with walnuts and allspice, while fruit notes are provided by plums. Following the overall theme here, the finish is also drier than that of the 16 year old variant, featuring a sprinkling of spicy cocoa powder. Relatively lengthy. Exclusively available to travelers at World Duty Free Group stores in selected airports throughout the UK and Spain. £90/liter",152.0,85,40.0,1.0
2732,John Hansell,"Situated between siblings Barterhouse and Old Blowhard in flavor profile. Firm spice, botanicals, dried fruit, and a kiss of honey rest on a bed of caramel, along with resinous oak, leather, dark chocolate, and a hint of tobacco on the finish. Lovely nose, but there's substantial oak on the palate. The sweeter notes make an effort to balance the oak, but the oak still dominates. For these who like drier, spicier bourbon.",85.0,85,45.0,2.0
2739,Lew Bryson,"Interesting that the label says “Artfully Aged,” yet there’s no actual age statement. Lively nose, good rye snap and spice, a bit of mint and oaky edge. Not hot, well-behaved on the tongue, and happily gives back everything taken on the nose. Sweet, spicy, and easy to like, this is whiskey without flaw, well-done and tasty, if not overly ambitious or challenging.",42.0,85,40.0,2.0
2740,Lew Bryson,"Made from an Irish whiskey recipe from 1865 (“dug up” by David Wondrich), with malt, raw barley, rye malt, and rolled oats, distilled in an alembic pot still. Amber with a distinct red/pink cast to it. Very fruity nose—greengage plum, mulberry, sweet orange—with creamy vanilla. Tastes of sweet cereal with a firm bitter keel; the fruit returns as an echo in the finish. A very craft beer-like whiskey; challenging, interesting, unexpected. A bit brash, but worth investigating.",90.0,85,43.8,3.0
2742,Dave Broom,"Aultmore is normally light and estery, and this pale dram is true to this. After a whiff of fresh turmeric, there’s an almost oily green note with William pear before acetone, and something akin to school Bunsen burners (a good smell) emerges. The palate is more coherent than the nose; sweet, rounded, and more substantial that you expect, with tinned pears in custard. Lively and charming; shows none of the firmness of youth suggested by the nose.",53.0,85,55.0,1.0
2743,Dave Broom,"Remarkably rich color, indicative of a first-fill cask. A clean if hot nose with carpenter’s workbench, Comice pear, and lots of oak. Aultmore’s acidity comes through on the palate, with its zingy intensity cutting through the wood and achieving a certain balance. The palate shows a mix of fruit and wood sugars. Young certainly, but bottled at the right time given the intensity of the wood element. Water makes it more sappy and summery. Not hugely complex, but fun.",85.0,85,53.2,1.0
2746,Lew Bryson,"Wigle’s also doing a series of finishing experiments with the addition of honeycombed wood chunks to their organic wheat whiskey; this one uses white ash. Sweeter nose than the straight-up wheat whiskey (see below); mouth is cleaner, and the astringency I noted on the end is ameliorated. All a matter of degrees though; quite similar to the regular wheat whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",27.0,85,46.0,3.0
2747,Lew Bryson,"The first bourbon made in Pennsylvania in over 25 years, using locally-grown, organic Wapsie Valley dent corn, which comes in yellow and maroon; a 1 year old bottling. The aroma is distinctive: deep mint, clove, and red plum. Warming and sweet, then broadening on the palate, the corn becomes prominent. Finish is hot, but tasty. This is a young one, with promise.",58.0,85,46.0,3.0
2748,Lew Bryson,"Organic Pennsylvania-grown rye, 3 years old, pot-distilled a 20-minute walk from the Monongahela River. Nose: sharp rye and hard oak, floral wreathing, but not hair-crispingly hot. Oh, nice rye mouth, flavorful, not overly bitter, the oak’s held in check, and there’s a minty sweetness to it. Finish is well-tempered, until a note of perfume sneaks in at the end.",62.0,85,50.5,3.0
2750,Lew Bryson,"Big mint/grass nose with sweet grain and a touch of vanilla behind it. Fiery, slippery with rye oiliness, popping with that mint, and rye-bitter on the finish; a bit of a bully. That's not all bad, though; too many ryes strive to be smooth these days, but this lets it rock, and does it well. A chunk of ice doesn't hurt this at all. Potent, bold. Sourced whiskey.",27.0,85,50.0,
2751,Lew Bryson,"Wyoming Whiskey (Kirby, Wyo.) is making bourbon from Wyoming grain, on a column still, aged in full-sized barrels...in the Wyoming climate. Minty, grassy, meadow-varied plants; a bit of cedar and old clothes. Mouth is fuller, with more corn sweetness and balance than the small batch (see below). Notes of sweet citrus, rye punchiness, and that cedar flit by quickly in the mouth, and the finish is long and smooth. Much preferred over the small batch.",49.0,85,44.0,3.0
2752,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Floral and spice, including orange blossom and clove, this pours berry fruit on the palate before the chocolate malt balls set in. Seamless, nicely done, and certainly moreish, as the clean, drying finish gives way to biscuit, brioche, and pain au chocolat.",70.0,85,46.0,3.0
2754,Dave Broom,"Initially very ozonic, fresh, and marine. So much so that you don’t notice the smoke which is slowly building. Everything is very restrained, some cold-smoked fish, mineral, and—in time—a hint of the mash tun. That mineral note continues on the palate, which broadens into ginger nuts in the middle of the tongue. All very well-balanced, and at its best neat.",110.0,85,57.2,1.0
2755,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Like many older corn whiskies, this one unfolds slowly. Strong Cadbury caramel bar and slightly meaty, with sour fruits and cedar on the nose. Sweet and hot, with floral notes and initially a discordant touch of perfume. Pulling tannins provide structure for glowing pepper, sultanas, sweet spring flowers, some earthiness, and a touch of wet slate. Not as woody as most whiskies this age; a testament to long maturation in used barrels. (Cadenhead’s exclusive, Great Britain and Europe) £128",160.0,85,58.3,4.0
2758,Dave Broom,"The impact given by secondary maturation in small (octave) sherry casks is what sets this range apart. Here, Glen Grant’s light fruits are given a darker twist, with some bodega notes, blackberry, and a surprising note of curry spices before milk chocolate develops; this is particularly apparent on the palate. The palate is gentle and quite creamy (cream sherry?) but it doesn’t like water. A pleasing dram. £99",151.0,85,47.7,1.0
2762,Dave Broom,"Good to see Pittyvaich back in the Special Release roster. Here we have the heavy, nutty character of the distillery given full expression. The emphasis here is on a mix of nuts, cake mix, and dense fruits: even a little hint of cigarette tobacco. When neat, the palate has real density that is enlivened by water, which brings out fresher—and decidedly more green—notes. Worth a dram.",400.0,85,49.9,1.0
2765,Dave Broom,"As if making up for lost time, wee bottles of Kininvie are popping out every month. This is a fine demonstration of the distillery style which sits—appropriately enough—between the lightness of Glenfiddich and the fruity sweetness of Balvenie. Here, flowers are to the fore, along with creme anglaise, and a light herbal edge. There’s some weight to the palate, but very little oakiness. A perfumed finish akin to elderflower maintains the frothy floral aspect. A perfect spring dram. £120",173.0,85,42.6,1.0
2767,Lew Bryson,"Aged 2 years, 1 month in 53-gallon charred oak barrels, it's straight. So's the nose: green, herbal and oily with rye, and backed by oak. Mouth is honest: youthfully zesty rye flavors, grassy freshness, oak and alcohol warmth, and a savory rye finish. Nothing gets in the way of a pure experience. Good young rye.",65.0,85,45.0,
2768,Lew Bryson,"Good bourbon nose—oak, corn, allspice, a little sweet citrus—but some solvent notes flitting around too. Feisty in the mouth; warming, punchy oak, softer pillow-thumps of corn, and some bitter rye notes. More rye comes out as it sits. Finish is long and warm. Good young bourbon; priced like a good older bourbon. Craft still presents some hard choices.",45.0,85,45.0,3.0
2770,Lew Bryson,"Same specs as the Secale Rye Single Barrel (see above). Grassy nose, spicy hard candy, hot mint, and split-rock dryness. Dry rye grain, a tweak of bitterness, and alcohol heat. Finish is a bit oily/sticky. Good example of the modern MGP-inspired rye interpretation: grain-forward and no-nonsense.",75.0,85,50.0,3.0
2771,Lew Bryson,"Is it whiskey? Sorghum’s a grain, but sorghum syrup is pressed from the stalk of the plant. But HighWire Distilling uses Muddy Pond sorghum syrup, which mashes the grain in with the stalk. So…we’ll say yes, whiskey. Spritely on the tongue: lively and quick, sweet but spicy with oak, and not an off note. Crying for a cube and a shot of seltzer. Whiskey? Probably. Good? Yes!",49.0,85,44.0,3.0
2772,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Canada’s sub-arctic Yukon Territory has become fertile ground for making whisky. Blended from a mix of barrels distilled in 2009, then finished in Pedro Ximenez sherry barrels, Two Brewers Release 2 shows multi-layered complexity. Lovely sherry notes meld into rich malty grain.

2773,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Caldera Distilling of River John, Nova Scotia sits across Northumberland Strait from Green Gables, Prince Edward Island. Its namesake whisky is made in a tiny alembic still from grain grown right on the distillery property, then blended with rye whisky from Alberta.

2775,Fred Minnick,"An 8 year old Kentucky straight bourbon finished in Oregon oak that apparently brings about vanilla cake batter, caramel, hints of coffee, and citrus. Soft and delicate to the taste, with exploding French toast notes, cinnamon, allspice, and a hint of blueberry jam. The finish comes and goes, but leaves an impressive watermelon Jolly Rancher-cinnamon combo at the end. This one is meant to be sipped without the addition of water or ice. Sourced whiskey.",50.0,85,45.0,2.0
2776,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Fresh oak, sweet malt, caramel, and spiced cherries flirt with cracked pepper on the nose, while the smooth and sweet palate offers up clean flavors of citrus zest, butterscotch, drying oak, and saddle leather.

Hot peppers, hints of green licorice, and caramel. C$95",74.0,85,46.0,4.0
2779,Dave Broom,"Also distilled in 2009, this is mid-gold in color and medium weight, with a mass of sage-like smoke. More cask influence than 7.1, with smoked coconut, and again a mix of sweet fruits and lemon behind this smoky lead. Oily and rich, but a little fragmented on the tongue; the elements are beginning to cohere to produce integrated complexity. Octomore in mellow mood, with smoked chestnut and a little farmyardy Pinot note. Another positive work in progress report. £125",191.0,85,58.5,1.0
2780,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"An intense nose offers complexity with minty herbal notes, licorice, fresh-sawn oak, and peppery spice at the forefront, giving way to pithy orange peel on the palate.

2784,Fred Minnick,"Delicate and flavorful chocolate, caramel, and dried fruit begin a delightful sipper that really becomes easy drinking, with hints of cola, cherry, and maple syrup.

2787,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"An enjoyable 2 year old from Colorado, the sweet stone fruit nose, laced with mint and herb garden, betrays this spirit as a bit young and primary.

2789,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Driven by earthy oak and dark cocoa on the nose, this whiskey is alluring in its rustic richness, with saddle leather and a pocketful of dried fruit pulled from an old backpack.

Pleasingly drinkable, with caramel and more oak on the modest finish.",49.0,85,42.0,3.0
2793,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"This whiskey shows some green-spirit youth, but it’s headed in a good direction, with sassafras, toasted nuts, leather, forest aromas, and a touch of furniture polish. It’s much bigger on the palate, as burnt peanut candies meet baking spices, and treacle. The wood jumps out a bit and the fiery youth is undeniable, but plenty to like. (2,580 bottles)",45.0,85,50.0,3.0
2794,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"The nose offers a nice mélange of herbal and fruit notes, as pine sap, earthy forest floor, and menthol balance with sweet Bananas Foster and baked apple.

2800,Lew Bryson,"Aged 10 years in icewine barrels — a Canadian specialty — and like icewine, comes in a tiny bottle. Sweet malt aromas, some grape character, with a brandy-like edge slicing through it. The high proof comes through as evaporative rather than hot, and it’s quite drinkable undiluted: some creaminess even, and some of that sweet icewine intensity to it. A drop of water brings more whisky out: bold, a bit hot. The icewine finishing is an experiment with promise. Price is per 250 ml.",50.0,84,,4.0
2803,Dave Broom,"Cardhu—for me, at least—means intensity, and this delivers precisely that, with masses of
citrus (bergamot and grapefruit) and just a hint of dark chocolate behind. With
water, there’s red apple and Victoria plum, while the mouth is precise, with
any richness cut with fresh acidity. Zesty and fresh on the finish. Try it in a

2807,John Hansell,"New packaging, new formulation, and even a new strength. The new packaging is more stylish, the new formulation is more approachable, as is the new strength (45% rather than 50.5%). The previous Russell’s Reserve was big and brooding, with huge flavors of chewy toffee, oak, leather, and tobacco. This new expression is more elegant, with lighter sugars (honey, cotton candy, caramel, maple syrup), more fruit (candied orange, pineapple, coconut), and creamy vanilla. A tame expression of Wild Turkey (although the flavors are nicely balanced and seamlessly tied together). Ideally, I would like to see the bourbon with the new formula but bottled at the old strength of 101 proof.",29.0,84,45.0,2.0
2808,John Hansell,"Dry, spicy, and leathery on the nose, with candied fruit and toffee. Similar on the palate, but the dryness takes a more demonstrable role, especially toward the finish -- leather, dried vanilla, warming cinnamon, and brittle mint, with some candied fruit, toffee, and molasses struggling to prop it all up. Bottom line here: this year’s offering has less of the richness, fullness, lush fruitiness, and sweetness that balanced all the dried spice and leather notes the past two years (I rated both a 94).

A noticeable improvement from the Classic. This 12 year old is worth the few extra bucks. It’s the most rounded and balanced of the three new whiskies.",45.0,84,40.0,1.0
2827,Gavin Smith,"The 11 year old triple distilled Lowland single malt in this bottling has been matured entirely in French oak casks that previously contained Bordeaux wine, then bottled at cask strength. The nose offers contrasting sweet and sour fruit notes, red grapes and gooseberries, damp newspaper, warm stone, and vanilla. Herbal, with cloves and spearmint. Mouth-coating, bittersweet on the palate, with molasses and — inevitably — red wine. Dark chocolate, raisins, and aniseed in the drying finish.",70.0,84,58.0,1.0
2828,Gavin Smith,"Another recent addition to Aberdeenshire bottler Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range, launched late last year. The nose is very fruity, with sliced peaches and apricots, plus a porridge-like background note. Relatively full bodied and malty, with intense fruit notes, then dark spices appear. The finish is medium in length, spicy with aniseed balls, then a lingering creaminess at the very end. £42",66.0,84,46.0,1.0
2829,Gavin Smith,"Morrison Bowmore distillers has recently released a virgin oak-matured expression of its Auchentoshan single malt, which has no age statement. The North American oak casks have been charred prior to receiving this Lowland whisky as their first fillings. The result is a nose of Madeira, cinnamon, vanilla, and white pepper. Very spicy on the palate, with citrus fruits and plain chocolate. Lingering in the finish, with cocoa powder, icing sugar; becoming slightly more bitter with time.",70.0,84,46.0,1.0
2830,John Hansell,"Light to medium in body, but quite flavorful. Firm spice notes and subtle brine (both of which are often found in Northern Highland malts) makes the whisky fresh and quite lively. There’s a soothing, mouth-coating, toffee sweetness providing balance and depth. This is the first distillery bottling of Balblair available here in the U.S. in a long time, and it is very welcomed.",50.0,84,40.0,1.0
2831,Gavin Smith,"The third and final release of the 1989 vintage of Northern Highland malt Balblair is on sale in Europe initially, with U.S. availability (at approximately $95) this fall. Initially quite reticent on the nose, with a hint of potato chips, mild vanilla, lemon, and unripe bananas. Full and rounded on the palate; nutty, with tropical fruits and lively spice. Medium length in the finish, with apricots, instant coffee, and milky cocoa.  £60",94.0,84,43.0,
2832,Gavin Smith,"This 2002 expression of Balblair replaces the previous 2001 vintage as the ‘entry level’ bottling. It is naturally colored and non-chill filtered, in line with the rest of the Balblair range, and has been matured in bourbon barrels. Fizzy lemonade, banana skins, and violets on the nose, with soft caramel developing in time. Fruit and nut milk chocolate on the palate, with ripe apples and vanilla. Long, floral, and lively in the finish. £40",63.0,84,46.0,1.0
2833,Gavin Smith,"Balblair’s 1996 vintage expression replaces the previous 1995 variant as a travel retail-exclusive bottling, and maturation has taken place in bourbon casks. Ginger snaps, peaches, pineapple, and vanilla on the relatively light, fresh nose, which also has just a wisp of smoke in the background. Medium-bodied, the palate offers soft toffee, milk chocolate, spices, and the same fruit notes as the nose. The finish is quite lengthy, with a final flourish of black pepper. Price is per one liter.",80.0,84,46.0,1.0
2834,Dave Broom,"Big sherry influence immediately, with walnut skin, raisin bread, and mixed peels. Seems pretty dry, and the malty undertow here is whole grain bread. Balvenie’s signature sweetness comes across like soft brown Demerara sugar before it shifts into forest floor, mulch, nut, and dried berries. Just enough residual sweetness to keep the tannins at bay. Water makes it more woody, with burlap, cacao, a little earthiness, and a slightly bitter exit.",100.0,84,47.8,1.0
2835,Dave Broom,"The mix of honey, citrus, fruit, and malt which sits at Balvenie’s core is beginning to deepen. The citrus fruits, for example, are becoming concentrated, the honey is set clover, the fruits moving into cooked apricot and banana. Rounded and thick in the mouth, where the honeyed aspects and fleshiness of the fruits take control, before a bloom of bridal bouquet. Tremendously complex, here’s Balvenie's flowering into mid-period maturity. The price is…scary! £700",,84,60.7,1.0
2836,John Hansell,"Finished in a pedro ximinez cask. This is the sweetest and most tactile of the three whiskies. Peat smoke married with lush notes of sultana, ripe peaches, pineapple, white chocolate, shortbread, and thick honey. Delicate floral notes (heather, lavender) add finesse. I expected a darker personality with the sherry finish. I was pleasantly surprised.",85.0,84,46.0,
2837,John Hansell,"Deeper and darker in character than the BenRiach 25 year old also reviewed here, with more sherry character. Chewy toffee, nougat, and rum infused with raisin provide the foundation of this whisky. Background notes of cinnamon, baker’s chocolate, and a suggestion of wet leather and old parchment add intrigue.",450.0,84,45.0,1.0
2838,John Hansell,"A peated version of Benriach that was also finished in a port pipe. There is a really nice blend of flavors here; a sweet malty foundation layered with ripe red fruit notes (raspberry, strawberry preserve, currant) and a firm blanket of smoke that goes on and on. All the flavors are bold, but they’re equally balanced. Not a subtle whisky but quite entertaining. (A Binny’s Beverage Depot exclusive.)",54.0,84,59.5,1.0
2839,Gavin Smith,"This peated expression was matured in quarter casks and is the first bottling to be launched since BenRiach was acquired by Brown-Forman in April 2016. The nose offers sweet peat and new leather, coal, and a hint of iodine. White pepper and big peat notes on the palate. Ripe apples develop and spices spread around the mouth. The finish is medium in length, warming, and gently smoky. £65",81.0,84,46.0,1.0
2840,Dave Broom,"What you look for in a finished whisky is for some of the distillery's character to be apparent, but also enhanced. Benrinnes is a big, meaty dram, which suits sherry and its feral aspect is there. Think of roast beef with damson jam, date, and blackberry. The palate is thick with licorice sweetness and a bitter edge. It has power, and while you can see the join between original spirit and finish, it’s a pretty happy match. £60/500 ml",101.0,84,52.9,
2841,Dave Broom,"Meaty, beaty, big, but only slightly bouncy. The nose is initially reminiscent of curried mutton with an added heathery earthiness and some distillery sulfur. It then dries into biltong/pemmican with some faint barley notes behind. The water adds a note of fresh coriander. Massive in the mouth, with raisin, roasting tins. It’s a relief when water releases some surprisingly soft treacle toffee sweetness, but it’s not quite enough to balance the massive meaty assault. (2,892 bottles)",400.0,84,56.9,1.0
2842,John Hansell,"The oldest of the group, and it shows. When compared to younger expressions, there’s less peaches and more citrus (lemon, tangerine). It is thicker on the palate-with notes of fat barley and crème brulee-before dry, resinous oak notes intensify. Dry, spicy finish. Not as even-keeled as younger expressions, but quite dynamic.",125.0,84,43.0,1.0
2843,Dave Broom,"The newest member of the ever-expanding range hailing from Gordon & MacPhail’s own distillery in Forres. This example has been aged in port pipes — and it shows immediately on the nose. Benromach is a teasing mid-weight Speysider, and this has added depth of sweet damson jam-like aromas mixed with Seville orange (marmalade) and some milky nut. Rich fruitcake flavors on the tongue. This is a very well balanced and precocious 12 year old. Worth a look.",80.0,84,50.0,1.0
2844,Gavin Smith,"Initially matured in bourbon barrels for 6 years, the spirit was then aged for a further 31 months in wine casks from the Hermitage Appellation d’Origine Contrôlée. Soft on the nose, with fresh red berries, oiled leather, cinnamon, and a hint of smoke. Rich, slightly smoky cherry and berry notes on the palate, plus milk chocolate and lively spices. Initially fruity, then drying in the finish with wood smoke and light tannins.",53.0,84,45.0,1.0
2845,John Hansell,"Pale gold color. Aromas reminiscent of a holiday spice cake-ginger, cinnamon, honey, and a touch of citrus fruit. Medium bodied, but it coats the palate-there's some viscosity here. The flavors are rather soothing and very much like its aroma, with a malty sweetness throughout and a lingering finish.
   Style: Highland single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $80s. Limited availability. 
   The owners of Blair Athol have chosen not to export this whisky to the U.S. For this reason it can be rather difficult to find, only occasionally being imported by one of the independent bottlers. This particular expression is a very good example from this distillery.",90.0,84,58.1,1.0
2846,Dominic Roskrow,"This distillery-only bottling strips away the sweet gloopiness of the standard 12 year old — and is all the better for that. The nose is soft and gentle, with rose petals and rose hips over a base of ripe plum and a touch of ginger cake. The palate is intriguing and holds the attention, with citrus fruits, bitter apple, spice, and a touch of peppermint. It is all very clean, sophisticated, and pleasant. The finish is long and warming, and the overall experience is highly enjoyable. Justified as a distillery-only bottling? Without a doubt.",100.0,84,55.8,1.0
2847,Gavin Smith,"New to Duncan Taylor’s Dimensions range is this single cask (#2927), cask strength offering from Perthshire’s Blair Athol distillery. Sweet and fruity on the nose, majoring in tinned pineapple in syrup. Toffee, nougat, and a hint of freshly-dug soil make up the supporting aromatic cast. Full bodied and initially as sweet in the mouth as it was on the nose, with vigorous spices, particularly nutmeg, then it begins to dry. The long finish is characterized by powdery cocoa and oak tannins. £80",125.0,84,50.5,
2848,Dave Broom,"There have been some legendary Hart Brothers bottlings of Bowmore (the 1966 bottled in ’74 is a classic) so this has a lot to live up to. The nose is creamy and discreet, but Bowmore is less about charging out wreathed in smoke and more a dram where peat is part of the totality. Here you get seashells and low-tide aromas, along with green banana. The palate is gently smoked with light barley, cool melon. An afternoon dram. £50",78.0,84,55.5,
2849,Dave Broom,"Sadly, the final chapter in a series which deservedly acquired cult status because of the way it showed how well Bowmore behaved in close proximity to sherry casks. This was aged in oloroso and PX and has a thick, dark nose, all dried black fruits and saddlebags. The smoke is sotto voce. The savory nature continues on the palate. It needs water to bring out fresh fruits, and while there’s a bitterness on the end, that’s a minor cavil. £190",274.0,84,56.7,1.0
2850,Dave Broom,"This vatting of three virgin oak casks and one oloroso butt was so keenly priced that it sold out in seconds, all 1,500 bottles of it. It shows Bowmore, that ever-changing, elusive Islay dram in perfumed, scented mode. I picked up vetiver (an integral part of classic male cologne), but also peach, some flamed peels, and plenty of smoke. The palate dips into the sea for a second, then again becomes scented, alongside gentle chocolate. Amazing price too. £55",71.0,84,54.9,1.0
2851,John Hansell,"Aged in bourbon casks and then enhanced in Rioja wine casks. A mélange of red berry fruits, firm malt, thick vanilla and spicy oak, along with a hint of grape skin, anise, and orange peel. Gritty, dry finish.",75.0,84,46.0,1.0
2852,John Hansell,"Aged in refill sherry casks. One taste bears this out with its dominant honeyed fruit foundation (lemons, melons, pineapple). Still, that Bruichladdich freshness and appetizing ""sea breeze"" character dovetails nicely. Fuller, more rounded, and with a bit more going on here than the Full Strength expression reviewed below, but not as appetizing.",75.0,84,,
2853,John Hansell,"Aged in used bourbon barrels. A fresh, appetizing whisky of brine and white pepper, with an underlying foundation of vanilla, barley, and grassy/hay-like notes. A very subtle teasing of citrus lingers throughout. Very clean and straight-forward, with an appetizing finish. A whisky aperitif?",90.0,84,,1.0
2854,John Hansell,"It is unusual to find a Bruichladdich whisky with this much sherry influence-this one is aged in a refill sherry hogshead. I must admit that I generally like a less sherried Bruichladdich-it makes it easier to appreciate the distillery's subtle complexities. While there certainly is more than enough sherry to go around in this whisky, the distillery character does manage to fight its way through. This whisky's strong point is that the sherry influence is clean and not insipid like some sherried whiskies. Chewy caramel, toffee, and ripe fruit notes are most evident in this whisky, with Bruichladdich's signature-an appetizing fresh briny character-emerging midway on the palate through to the finish. If you like Bruichladdich and you appreciate a cleanly sherried whisky, then I think you'll enjoy this one.",65.0,84,,1.0
2855,John Hansell,"Fruit is the common thread to this lightly peated whisky; red fruit, that is. Red raspberry, red currant, red seedless grape, strawberry, and red apple. A gentle sweetness (creamy vanilla, light molasses) balances all this fruit. Not overly contemplative, but delightful. This is definitely  not the same Rocks I reviewed two years ago. It is richer, darker in color, and tastes more mature. It's an improved version, and my rating reflects this.",50.0,84,46.0,
2856,Dave Broom,"Since its reopening eleven years ago this year, Bruichladdich has been growing barley on Islay—a laudable move. This glimpse into the developing program shows what seems initially to be a delicately fragile dram that soon reveals an intense sweet depth behind the spring flowers. This purity of intent continues on the palate with a thick creaminess that’s typical of the distillery, while a tart finish adds interest. Precocious, but already beautifully balanced.£38",60.0,84,50.0,1.0
2857,Dave Broom,"More from Bruichladdich. The latest in the Elements series is clean in a freshly-showered kind of fashion. The fact that it’s backed up with bran, agave syrup, and pancake batter just helps to emphasize this image of a sunlit breakfast. The palate is sweet, fat, and juicy, typical of how texture is as important as flavor with the Laddie. In time there’s some cinnamon with a preserved lemon acidity that enlivens the finish. £55 (500 ml)",85.0,84,54.7,1.0
2858,Dave Broom,"Some single malts just suit specific cask types. Such is the case with Bunnahabhain and sherry. The spirit has a soft and nutty undertow, plus a gingery note that is given weight and depth by the cask. Amontillado, with its nuttier character, is an ideal bridge between the two. This shows surprising maturity with more oxidized and mulch aromas alongside coffee grounds, and a character that’s drifting into meaty. Brooding, medium-bodied, slightly dry…but the price? Ouch! (Fèis Ìle 2016, 250 bottles) £250",325.0,84,54.0,1.0
2859,Dominic Roskrow,"Without water, this is an aggressive malt, sharp and acerbic. With water, it’s still more in your face than any official bottling. Where you tend to associate Caol Ila with oily, peaty, and maritime characteristics, this is altogether more feisty and ballsier, with a glance to the big three peaty distilleries in the south of Islay, and even a nod to its peppery cousin on Skye. On the nose there is peat, but it is tempered by dark chocolate; some citrus there, too. The taste is quite sharp, with bitter lemon, licorice, and sooty peat to the fore. Certainly an interesting take on this intriguing distillery, and far removed from last year’s relatively gentle 25 year old release, but there are questions over the balance, and whether it’s a better whisky is a moot point.",153.0,84,58.4,1.0
2860,Dave Broom,"Pale straw. Delicate and a little akin to chilled manzanilla sherry: fresh almond, salinity, light yeast. Vibrant, with the smoke held in check. The palate is much sweeter, with finally some cask-derived sugars beginning to show. Then it rushes to the shoreline and takes a gulp of water, giving an effect like saltwater taffy. It needs water to flesh the palate out. £60/500 ml",101.0,84,61.2,
2861,Gavin Smith,"This single cask bottling of Clynelish from Wemyss Malts is 16 years old, and just 302 bottles were yielded by the bourbon hogshead in which maturation took place. Milk chocolate, orange, and malt on the nose; fragrant, with stem ginger. Zesty and notably spicy on the palate, with applesauce, peaches, and digestive biscuits. Relatively long in the finish, with oak, allspice, and persistent fruitiness.£67",108.0,84,46.0,1.0
2862,John Hansell,"If you’re looking for a bold, dry, spicy Speysider, this is the one. There’s lots of oak here, with bourbon undertones. A fighting vanilla sweetness manages to keep the whisky from becoming too austere. Gritty texture, with cedar wood, clove, spearmint, anise, herbal notes, dried fruit, and dark chocolate. A whisky that awakens the palate. Very invigorating. (Exclusive to The Whisky Exchange, London.)  Price: approximately $100.",100.0,84,56.7,1.0
2863,John Hansell,"Half the whisky was aged in bourbon barrels, the other half in sherry casks. This whisky has always been on my short list as one of the finest, most affordable 12 year old single malts available. While the price may have gone up a bit (I remember when it was $20!), the quality remains the same. It’s fresh and lively. A well-balanced dram, with its tell-tale orange marmalade accompanied by tangerine, pineapple upside-down cake, vanilla-soaked barley, subtle brine, and caramel, all leading to a spicy cinnamon and dried vanilla finish. A nice “every day” dram.",45.0,84,40.0,1.0
2864,John Hansell,"Aged exclusively in first-fill casks (60% of it sherry cask), and its oak intensity shows. Sweet, but with a steady dose of dried spice, oak resin, and teasing tobacco to back it up. Silky texture and lush, with fallen orchard fruit, tangerine, chocolate-covered orange, and lemon meringue. A firm dried spice finish rounds it all out. Sort of like The Dalmore 12 year old pumped up on steroids.",65.0,84,40.0,1.0
2865,John Hansell,"Matured in oloroso casks. The oloroso takes what is typically a pleasingly honeyed, but not particularly complex, malt and adds a layer of fruit to it. Crisp, clean notes of lemon, pineapple, and ginger, are softened by honeyed malt, vanilla, and hay. Soft, lingering finish.",65.0,84,43.0,
2866,Gavin Smith,"Distilled between October and March, matured in American (first-fill and refill) and European oak casks; meant to be served ice-cold. From the freezer, concentrated aromas of pineapple, hints of honey and smoke. At room temperature, less intense fruitiness, more honey, and ginger. A syrupy mouthfeel from the freezer, with soft spices and orchard fruits. The palate is more complex at room temperature, with heathery spice, pepper, apricots, raisins, and milk chocolate. The finish yields cocoa powder and lingering spices. £38",58.0,84,43.0,
2867,John Hansell,"The fourth release of peated Edradour whisky. This time it’s aged in oloroso sherry casks. There’s a lot going on in this whisky. Yeah, it’s still a little on the young side, but what it lacks in maturity is compensated by a dynamic youthful complexity. A distinctive whisky, with coal tar, damp kiln smoke, caramelized fruit, smoked almond, walnut, licorice stick, and maple-cured bacon. Youthful, sweet, smoky, lingering finish. I’m looking forward to future releases. (6,000 bottles released, but only 900 to the U.S.).",100.0,84,46.0,1.0
2868,Gavin Smith,"The latest in this Perthshire distillery’s ongoing Port Cask series of releases has been wholly matured in a bodega port butt since being distilled in 2003. The nose is fragrant, featuring summer berries and glacé cherries, while the palate suggests canned pineapple with cream, contrasting with red wine notes. The finish is quite lengthy, with raspberries, spicy oak, and a whiff of smoke.",90.0,84,46.0,1.0
2869,Gavin Smith,"The eighth edition of heavily-peated Edradour bottled under the Ballechin label is part of the distillery’s Discovery Series and has been aged in Sauternes wine casks. The nose yields sweet, fruity smoke, cocoa, and spice. Sweet and soft on the palate, with more fruity smoke, notably pineapple-influenced, with a hint of smoked fish. The finish is medium to long, with ashy peat and slightly bitter citrus fruits.",135.0,84,46.0,1.0
2870,John Hansell,"A nice example of what port wood finishing should do for a whisky. The port influence (finished one year in a port pipe) has taken what would normally have been a fairly straight-forward whisky when it is young-clean, light, and dry with subtle notes of herbs and spices-and added some extra weight along with balancing sweet toffee and full fruit, without dominating. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)",50.0,84,46.0,1.0
2871,John Hansell,"What is it with all these older, sherried bottles of Glen Grant from the independent bottlers, anyway? Fortunately, this is one of the nicer ones. The balance of sherry and oak is commendable, and the flavor is clean with that Glen Grant “dried herb” character still evident. Sweet fruit notes (berries in honey, peach pits, sultana, ripe grape) along with almonds and tobacco fill out the palate. Clean, warming finish.",145.0,84,53.5,1.0
2872,Dave Broom,"The initial nose is soft fruits doused in condensed milk, which contributes to an overall impression of light toffee and, weirdly for this distillery in its contemporary guise, some smoke. The fruits manage to mix the ripe and slightly sour. Quite intense; it needs water, which calms proceedings allowing typical Glen Grant purity to come through. The fruits now have some added weight and, again, that smokiness. Intriguing! £75",127.0,84,57.8,1.0
2873,Dave Broom,"A new addition to the core range, this shows Glen Grant with a little more weight, but just a little. I’ve never been one for the heavily-sherried versions. Here, the distillery’s signature green elements—spring flowers, fresh apple and pear notes are given a little added weight—apple syrup, toffee, and cooked fruits on the palate. If you’d like an alternative to Glenlivet or Glenfddich 12 then look no further. £43",56.0,84,43.0,1.0
2874,Gavin Smith,"A Glen Ord bottled by the London wine and spirits establishment of Milroy’s, and a relatively rare opportunity to sample single malt from this Diageo-owned distillery. The nose initially presents lemon zest, then peaches and caramel, with cream soda notes. Very fruity and lively in the mouth, with a nutty, malty undercurrent. Medium in length; firm, with spicy fruit lasting to the very end, accompanied by a touch of well-mannered fresh oak. £45 Currently not available in the U.S.",74.0,84,46.0,1.0
2875,Gavin Smith,"This relatively youthful whisky was matured in bourbon barrels, before a period in Pedro Ximénez sherry casks. Sweet, red berry notes on the nose, with slightly smoky vanilla and caramel. Voluptuous in the mouth, with spicy, rich sherry notes, sultanas, and ginger. Spicy sea salt and lingering sherry in the finish. £37",58.0,84,46.0,1.0
2876,Dave Broom,"Here’s a rarity. A major player in Ballantine’s, this Moray coast distillery is rarely seen in single malt guise. Very gentle, sweet, and juicy start with licks of cream, a hint of barley, and the gentle grassiness typical of the distillery. In time, light almond and fresh lemon. The palate is lightly sticky — Glenburgie for its lightness always shows good succulence — with buttery vanilla, malt, and a touch of toasty oak. Gentle, sweet, and refreshing.",130.0,84,43.0,1.0
2877,John Hansell,"There’s plenty going on here, but it’s not as vibrant as the other GlenDronachs. Lots of sherry influence, viscous, and a bit sappy, with Curaçao, honey-drenched fruit, raspberry tart, black cherry, and ripe malt leading to a grape stem finish. An enjoyable whisky, but my least favorite of the bunch.",136.0,84,46.0,1.0
2878,Dave Broom,"In style, this is closest to the 1978 in its levels of sweetness. Here, though, there is added key lime pie, juicy white peaches, and whipped cream alongside that deep Glenfarclas roasted ‘polished brass’ note. The medium-weight palate is pure and sweet with light orchard fruits. The most freshly acidic of the selection, with a hint of flowers on the very end. £430",724.0,84,46.1,
2879,Dave Broom,"Named in honor of the early Portuguese explorers, this newest Glenfiddich expression has spent a lengthy period of secondary maturation in Madeira drums. This has given a rich sweet fruitiness — think blueberry muffins mixed with moss alongside date, fig, and black grape.

2886,Dave Broom,"Amontillado casks are used here, which add a certain almond-like note to the nose, as well as more obvious oakiness. The effect is a general deepening and lengthening of aroma and flavor. The dry notes have gone, replaced by a sweeter and more generous palette of flavors.

It is non-chill filtered and has been finished in manzanilla sherry casks. Fragrant, slightly salty, fruity sherry notes, sweet spices on the nose. New leather and lots of spice on the palate, with olives, rock salt, and a suggestion of red wine. Medium in length, drying, with licorice and black pepper. (12,000 bottles) £65",99.0,84,46.0,1.0
2889,John Hansell,"The first non-vintage Glenrothes in recent memory, allowing the distillery more flexibility in cask selection when making a bottling. True to Glenrothes, this expression is mouth-coatingly malty, with well-integrated bright fruit notes, creamy vanilla, praline and honey. Nutty, delicately spicy finish.",45.0,84,40.0,
2890,John Hansell,"Matured exclusively in ex-bourbon barrels (American white oak, or quercus alba), and certified kosher. It’s a softer, gentler version of Glenrothes. The bourbon oak influence is very evident, showing creamy vanilla and coconut, with additional fruit (orange creamsicle, pineapple, black raspberry, blueberry, and gooseberry). Soft, creamy vanilla finish. A pleasant, easy-going, seamless dram—and perhaps the most approachable Glenrothes whisky.",60.0,84,40.0,1.0
2891,John Hansell,"Fairly straight-forward but pleasing nonetheless. Creamy on the nose and palate. Nicely malty, too, with interwoven notes of vanilla, caramel custard, and hazelnut, offset nicely by dry oak spices and a hint of peat. A calming whisky best enjoyed after a very stressful day.",65.0,84,43.0,
2892,John Hansell,"Thick and very tactile. Malty, with good heft. Notes of vanilla, honey, biscuit, and caramel custard. A soothing, comforting whisky. On the surface, not very complex, but very satisfying nonetheless.",180.0,84,43.5,1.0
2893,John Hansell,"Amber-gold colored (not as dark as the other Beltramo’s offering here), with notes of caramel, honey, heather, and bright fruit, evolving into gentle cinnamon, vanilla, and ginger. Soft finish. A Highland Park for a lazy afternoon. (Bottled for Beltramo’s Fine Wines & Spirits)",120.0,84,53.8,1.0
2894,Gavin Smith,"Einar was joint Earl of Orkney from 1014, and this bottling moves the Warrior Series slightly further into familiar Highland Park territory. Some gentle smoke on the nose, with fresh newsprint, ginger, caramel, and a hint of halibut oil. Peat smoke, vanilla, and citrus fruit on the palate. A little peat smoke in the medium-length finish. €53/liter",68.0,84,40.0,1.0
2895,Gavin Smith,"This 17 year old single cask (#10042) bottling of Highland Park was distilled in September 1996 and is presented non-chill filtered and with no added color in Douglas Laing’s Old Particular range. Baked cereal and peeled apples on the peaty nose, while dark, smoky notes contrast with lighter, fruity flavors on the palate, along with a sprinkling of pepper. The finish dries, with more pepper, bonfire embers, and coffee grounds. £90",151.0,84,48.4,1.0
2896,Gavin Smith,"Dark Origins is a new addition to Highland Park’s core range, inspired by the distillery’s founder, Magnus Eunson. The recipe embraces twice as many first-fill sherry casks than that of Highland Park 12 year old. Chocolate malt, caramel, and ripe bananas on the nose, with a whiff of coal dust. Silky on the palate, with dry sherry, autumn berries, plus more coal and a spicy, plain chocolate edge. Long and dry in the smoky finish, with black pepper.",110.0,84,46.8,1.0
2897,John Hansell,"Style: Islay single malt scotch Color: Pale straw Aroma: Peat smoke-lots of it. Damp earth. Hint of olives and seaweed. Palate: Surprisingly gentle in texture and on the light side of medium in body. A malty sweetness balances the dry-ish peat smoke. Again the damp earth mid palate. An appetizing saltiness emerges towards the finish, but is fleeting. Smoky finish.",500.0,84,57.8,1.0
2898,John Hansell,"Distinctively pale in color. (A hint of its age?) This annual limited edition release is finally available in the U.S. Youthful, vibrant, and thumping, with the sea flowing through its veins. Coal tar, peat smoke, brine, seaweed, bright fruit (pear, tangerine), and soft vanilla all compete for attention. The only thing holding me back from scoring it higher is that it comes across as a bit too youthful.",60.0,84,50.5,1.0
2899,Dave Broom,"Brought back as a celebration of the distillery’s 200th anniversary and, in the vein of other 15 year old expressions, is somewhat restrained. Rather than big phenols there’s an aroma of lanolin, sautéed scallop, fleshy fruit, and real sweetness. The palate shoes some oozing oils and a whiff of creosote, but this is a tea party rather than a wild ceilidh. Maybe bottling at 46% would have given the drive that’s missing.",80.0,84,40.0,1.0
2900,John Hansell,"Quite nutty (especially the latter half of the palate), with chewy toffee, vanilla fudge, subtle fruit, and leafy smoke. I like the texture of this whisky. Quite satisfying. An improvement over the distillery-bottled 10 year old, which I suggested (Vol. 16, No. 2) needed to reach its teens to begin to fully develop. This whisky validates my theory. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)",65.0,84,46.0,1.0
2901,Gavin Smith,"As with Rosebank, Douglas Laing & Co. Ltd. has made a habit of releasing single malts from the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, which formerly stood not far from Auchentoshan. The latest variant was distilled in November 1991 and bottled early in 2012. The nose is fresh and fruity, with vanilla and boiled sweets. Sweetly spicy on the straightforward palate, with ginger to the fore. Spice continues through the finish, with a hint of cedar. £157",246.0,84,51.5,1.0
2902,Gavin Smith,"Cadenhead is responsible for this veteran cask strength release distilled in 1977 at the now-demolished distillery of Littlemill, located a couple of miles from Auchentoshan. The nose is sweet, with icing sugar, vanilla, honey, and peaches. Damp grass after a while. Initially sweet and full on the palate, slightly resinous, with marzipan and sherbet, then quite bitter oak kicks in. The marzipan and tannins fight it out in the finish. £175",282.0,84,40.2,
2903,John Hansell,"Amber color. Rich, malty aroma with notes of vanilla, honey, oak, and floral undertones. Thick, mouth-coating texture. Flavors are big and malty, with notes of honey and vanilla up front, then becoming rather dry with oak and subtle citrus. Huge, long dry finish.",140.0,84,40.0,1.0
2904,Dave Broom,"Plenty of the distillery’s fresh fruits, here with some Demerara sugar sprinkled on the top, a little hint of almond, peppermint, candied apple, and hard fruit sweets. The palate continues in the same vein, with some more apple (baked this time) and a chalky texture. Water allows it to become more creamy (think orange barley water), while a green fresh note emerges in the background. Just slightly bitter behind.",320.0,84,49.2,1.0
2905,John Hansell,"This expression is atypical for a Macallan whisky-the standard Macallan line is aged in sherry casks, while this one is aged in a bourbon cask. Absent the sherry, this isn’t as sweet or rich. Rather, it’s more delicate and gentle. The whisky is very clean and creamy, with lovely floral notes (lavender, heather, rose), intertwined with spices (especially vanilla), and fruit (baked apple, pineapple, coconut). Delicate, pleasing finish. One of the better non-sherried whiskies distilled at Macallan. (Bottled exclusively for retailer Wine on the 9.)",75.0,84,58.2,1.0
2906,John Hansell,"An interesting application of Macallan, aged originally in a bourbon cask and then in Ridge Zinfandel barrels. Quite sweet and full-flavored, with ripe, jammy fruit, beach plum, subtle (yet deep) toffee, and grape skin, all laced with honey. Dynamic, fun, and carefree.",70.0,84,46.0,1.0
2907,Dave Broom,"A mix of two types of cask, both refill. Typical Port Ellen on the nose, very clean, precise, and austere, hiding its sweetness in a new pigskin wallet. Though there are hints of apple and almond, it has a chalky edge and surprisingly low levels of smoke. With water there’s squid ink and waxed paper. The palate starts with Darjeeling tea and roasted fruits, then heads to the kelp-strewn seashore. As challenging as ever, and actually a bit too dry. £600",952.0,84,52.5,1.0
2908,John Hansell,"Straw gold color. A very aromatic whisky, with dry, delicate herbal, floral notes. Light and soft in body. Gentle on the palate-delicately sweet and fruity up front, then becoming dry with herbal, spice notes.",50.0,84,40.0,1.0
2909,John Hansell,"Pale gold color. Aromatic, floral, herbal aromas (a veritable potpourri), with soft background vanilla malt notes and a hint of lemon. Light and soft in body. Soft, malty vanilla notes on the palate with interwoven notes of herbs, subtle dried fruit, and delicate wood resins. Gently dry finish.",150.0,84,46.0,1.0
2910,John Hansell,"Thick barley and viscous, with ever-present brine and berried fruit throughout. Underlying notes of waxy fruit (no doubt from some sherry cask aging), clementine, pineapple, and black licorice emerge, followed by the brine kicking in again towards the finish. The most rambunctious of the three.",68.0,84,46.0,1.0
2911,Dominic Roskrow,"Springbank’s tasting room bottling of its triple-distilled malt will not disappoint any fan of the official bottling; all its rounded and honeyed characteristics are firmly in evidence here. The nose is soft and sweet, with praline and a touch of condensed sweet malt joining creamed vanilla. Without water, the malt is surprisingly robust and prickly. Dilute it, though, and it’s a very pleasant drink, with crystallized grapefruit, traces of hickory and menthol, some honey, and sweet candy. Later on, spice comes through, and the finish is long, fruity, and spicy. An interesting take, but not a radical departure from the official bottling.",95.0,84,47.4,1.0
2912,John Hansell,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Golden bronze Aroma: Syrupy. Honey. Fruit gum drops. Anise. Spearmint. Palate: Thick, viscous, surupy. Honey up front, then becoming dry through to the end, with notes of dried fruit, mint, and oak.",150.0,84,46.0,1.0
2913,John Hansell,"Very thick in texture and mouthcoating -- almost chewy -- with ripe barley, shortbread cookies, and honey up front. Dried vanilla, violet, cinnamon, and bright fruit notes emerge mid-palate. The dried spices and moderate oak tannins linger on the finish, contrasting the whisky’s rich, sweet entry. If this whisky were a road, there would be a lot of hills.",185.0,84,48.7,1.0
2914,John Hansell,"A tamed Talisker. The classic Talisker personality shows-seaweed, brine, peat smoke, and freshly ground pepper on the finish. There are even other interesting flavors I enjoy, notably vanilla, licorice root, charcoal, and bitter chocolate. But this whisky needs to be a little livelier to be a truly great whisky. While there’s no age statement, there’s older whisky in here for sure, and maybe that’s part of its “reserved” nature. It certainly is a nice whisky, but I would prefer the more vibrant Talisker 18 year old -at two-thirds the cost.",100.0,84,45.8,1.0
2915,Gavin Smith,"The latest release from Talisker is an NAS bottling which contains whisky matured in toasted and refill American oak casks. According to the distiller, this is “An easy-drinking Talisker…more approachable, but still definitely Talisker.” Certainly approachable on the nose, with tangerines, honey, and milk chocolate, before ozone and peat smoke develop. Ginger and a hint of coal tar. Medium-bodied, with citrus fruit and increasingly hot spices, though never overwhelming. Spicy peat, white pepper, and aniseed in a nutty finish. £33",48.0,84,45.8,1.0
2916,John Hansell,"Aged on the Scottish mainland for 14 years and then finished off in sherry casks on the Island of Mull. A fresh whisky with a hint of brine, along with richer nutty toffee and chocolate fudge, embedded with dried fruit. Delicate oak resin peppers the finish, balancing the whisky’s sweetness. One of the best unpeated Tobermory whiskies (i.e. non-Ledaig) whiskies I’ve tasted. The sherry enhances the whiskey without dominating.",110.0,84,46.3,1.0
2917,Dave Broom,"One of Speyside’s youngest distilleries, Tomintoul has been a relatively shy performer until recently, when a raft of new releases (some peated) have appeared. This non-chill filtered example is, for me, the best of the bunch. Pale in hue, it has a light, clean floral aroma — think daffodils — with plenty of white fruits and very subtle oak. The palate has pear juice, light vanilla, and a long sweet finish. £34 (Not available in the U.S.)",54.0,84,46.0,1.0
2918,Gavin Smith,"Selected by distillery manager Douglas Campbell, currently in his 50th year at Tomatin. It has been matured in a combination of American and European oak casks, and just 200 cases have been released. Citrus fruits on the nose, notably oranges, and apricots, with a hint of damp soil. More fruit on the palate, orange wine gums, ginger, and gentle oak. Long and slowly drying in the finish, with encroaching aniseed and tannins.",220.0,84,46.0,1.0
2919,Gavin Smith,"Tomatin Legacy has been matured in a combination of bourbon and virgin oak casks, and after an initial release in Europe, worldwide availability will follow. Honey and malt on the nose, melons; fragrant and mildly herbal. White pepper and ultimately a whiff of treacle. Fresh and lively on the sweet, fruity palate, with tinned pineapple, cake mix, and more pepper. Quite dry in the medium length finish, with a suggestion of chili. £26",40.0,84,43.0,1.0
2920,Gavin Smith,"The nose is nutty and earthy, with dry sherry, cooking apples, vanilla, and emerging icing sugar. Finally, a hint of sea salt.

2921,Gavin Smith,"Exclusive to North America, this bottling was matured in bourbon hogsheads for 9 years, and then finished in French oak casks for a further 3 years. The casks originally contained red wine from the Bacalhoa winery. Before use by Tomatin they underwent a de-char/re-char process. Peaches, vanilla, milk chocolate, and ginger on the nutty nose, with new-mown hay. Full-bodied, with toffee apples, black pepper, and cloves. Lingering warm spices in the finish. (12,000 bottles)",40.0,84,46.0,
2922,Gavin Smith,"This NAS cask strength expression of Tomatin was matured in a mix of bourbon and virgin American oak casks. The nose is sweet and fragrant, with vanilla, cinnamon, and developing coconut ice. Silky on the palate initially, softly spiced, with vanilla toffee, pears, and apples; then the spices intensify, introducing a hint of chili. Drying in the lengthy, spicy, slightly herbal finish.

2923,Gavin Smith,"The bourbon cask-matured partner to the Sherry Matured bottling (see above), this expression similarly comprises a vatting of whisky distilled in 1973, 1977, 1988, 1991, 2002, and 2006. Both Contrasting Casks are offered in non-chill filtered format. Apple pie, with buttery caramel, milk chocolate, and coconut on the nose. Zesty spices on the early palate, then custard, contrasting lemon, and a note of char. Spicy fruits, black pepper, and more char in the finish. £100",152.0,84,46.0,1.0
2924,Gavin Smith,"Initially aged in bourbon barrels, this expression was transferred into Cabernet Sauvignon wine casks in March 2011 for additional maturation. Musty wine notes on the early nose soon become red berries and vanilla. Supple on the palate, with big red berry notes, plus honey and ginger. Lingering ginger and raspberries in the finish, drying to dark chocolate (2,520 bottles) £70",87.0,84,46.0,1.0
2925,Gavin Smith,"This 9 year old bottling has been fully matured in Caribbean rum barrels. Quite delicate on the nose, with wet grass, then emerging coconut and whipped cream.

Spicy and nutty in the finish, with a final tropical fruit tang (6,600 bottles) £40",50.0,84,46.0,
2926,Dave Broom,"There’s something rather round peg in a square hole about Tormore, that grand urban palace of a distillery in wildest Speyside. The whisky, sadly, is often the same. Here, though, things look promising to start with: rice crackers, and a spicy, rye-like hardness on top of a vanilla-accented, sweet trail mix of a nose with some earthiness behind. The palate, for me, is still too rigid. For all its efforts to relax, this Tormore remains tense. £90",150.0,84,64.2,1.0
2927,Gavin Smith,"Tullibardine has been offering a 1988 vintage edition for several years, but in 2011 it bottled a new variant at 23 years of age, matured in a mixture of first-fill bourbon barrels and ex-sherry hogsheads. Malt, vanilla, carnations, and peaches on the full nose. The palate is initially sweet and fruity, with toffee, lively spices, and more herbal notes duly appearing. The finish features cereal, spice, and white chocolate. £47",75.0,84,46.0,1.0
2928,Gavin Smith,"Finished principally in Pedro Ximenez Spanish sherry casks, Tullibardine 500 Sherry has a fragrant nose, with new leather, beeswax, apple, and vanilla.

2929,Gavin Smith,"The second release in the Custodians’ series was matured in two sherry hogsheads—one first-fill and the other second-fill. This 46 year old is presented at cask strength. The early nose offers herbal and menthol notes, old resin, citrus fruits, then milk chocolate-coated peppermint creams… idiosyncratic. The palate is quite thin, with more citrus fruits, almonds, and developing wood notes. The finish is lightly oaky and mouth-drying, with a touch of black pepper.",1900.0,84,40.5,1.0
2930,Dave Broom,"This is clearly Oban. Time in Montilla fino casks hasn’t diminished the fresh fruitiness. The orange zestiness has also been retained. Like the ‘Kinchie, what the finish has done is allow the palate to thicken out and show what seems like a more mature personality. A new heavy floral note emerges. All in all, there is greater concentration and ripeness with an added ginger note. Another edition that improves on the original.",77.0,84,43.0,1.0
2931,John Hansell,"A blend of bourbon, rye, and smoky Scotch whisky. The foundation here is bourbon sweetness (caramel, toffee, vanilla) with a tug-of-war between rye spice (cinnamon, evergreen, nutmeg) and peat smoke. Tobacco and honey-soaked berries round out the palate, with additional leather notes on the finish. Not something I would drink every day, but this whisky packs plenty of intrigue. (sourced whiskey)",60.0,84,46.0,3.0
2932,Lew Bryson,"High West now has aged whiskey of their own make. This oat whiskey was aged “less than two years” in used cooperage, and that’s just what it looks like, about chardonnay color in the glass. The aroma is mellow and sweet, with a hint of flowers and grapes. Clean and surprisingly mellow sweet grain flavors, even a bit creamy, but the 46% delivers a high bite. Very nice finish.

(220 bottles) £100",131.0,84,46.0,
2949,Geoffrey Kleinman,"An uncommon exclusive bottling of a 6 year old cask strength malt. Light gold in color, the nose is vegetal, more peat bog than peat smoke, with an undercurrent of pastry cream and rose. It’s an odd combination of aromas. The entry is flavorful and inviting with smoked pineapple, clove, and rose. Peak smoke arrives in full force in the mid-palate, which drops the sweet and becomes spicy. The finish is mostly smoke, but with a pleasant minty coolness.  (Wyoming only)",95.0,84,59.8,1.0
2950,Dave Broom,"A new, and welcome, permanent member of the core Kilchoman range, this comes from a mix of sherry finished and sherry matured whisky. The nose kicks off with a lovely cigar ash note—a cigar club toward the end of the evening—and while there are some dried fruits from the sherry, Kilchoman’s gentle, light character gives energy and lemony lift—shellfish, grass, and herbs. Lovely balance. Rounded, softly fruity, and highly approachable.",75.0,84,46.0,1.0
2953,John Hansell,"Moderately rich, with layered caramel, vanilla, fig cake, and subtle sweet corn. Date, raisin, and a dusting of spice (cinnamon, cocoa, hint of ginger) round out the palate, leading to a gently sweet, soothing finish. A very versatile bourbon — certainly enjoyable enough to drink neat, but you won’t feel guilty if you make a cocktail with it or drink it on the rocks.",22.0,84,43.0,2.0
2954,Lew Bryson,"A toasty nose with bright citrus, spice, and oaky vanilla; you can feel the heat. Clearly Beam, but just as clearly different; there’s a flat spread to this, and a dry pull on the tongue and in the finish. Six-row barley has more husk to it, which can add tannins to beer; is there enough here to make a difference? It’s an interesting character, but it’s not all good. Price is per 375 ml.",50.0,84,45.0,2.0
2961,John Hansell,"A “branded” malt, meaning we don’t know which distillery this whisky came from. Fresh and quite fruity (peach, nectarine, golden raisin, orange, pineapple) with a nice underlying honey, vanilla, and caramel sweetness. Soft, gentle, malty finish. It’s clean, nicely balanced, and pleasant.",50.0,84,43.0,1.0
2963,Lew Bryson,"Sweet, rich candy — pulled taffy, boiled sweets — with a little hot edge. Signature Canadian sweetness, but with more depth and a gently mouth-coating feel. Touches of vanilla, caramel, and some of those candy notes again, but the finish isn’t cloying. No overt evidence of the toasted maplewood finishing. Another exploration of what Canadian whisky is, or can be, that stays within bounds and makes the sweet whisky idea work.",27.0,84,40.0,4.0
2964,Lew Bryson,"Triticale is a wheat/rye hybrid, which I guess appealed to the wheat-mad Dry Fly distillers. Aromas of grass, bubble gum, and oak. Taste is young, brashly sweet, but smooth enough to spread easily over the tongue. There’s spice—light cinnamon, a zip of allspice heat—and grassy brightness, but they’re dressing on the juicy sweet center. Not flawed, and well-made, but I wish it had more to say. Price is per 375ml.",30.0,84,44.0,3.0
2965,Gavin Smith,"Hazelburn was first produced at Springbank during 1997. It varies stylistically from ‘traditional’ Springbank, as it is triple distilled using unpeated malt. The 8 year old expression has been matured in 60 percent ex-bourbon and 40 percent sherry wood. The nose is fresh, light, fruity, and faintly resinous, with gentle spice. Sherbet, malt, and vanilla on the attractive and lively palate, with developing spicy oak and a hint of pepper in the finish.",70.0,84,46.0,1.0
2966,Lew Bryson,"From Finger Lakes distilling; one of two craft ryes I’m revisiting this issue. An interesting aroma of dry hay, dried fruit, and burlap that’s appealing to anyone who’s spent time on a farm. Smooth but not laid-back on the tongue, there’s plenty of good stuff going on here. Peppery rye, some soft fruit, that fresh burlap, and an urgent but not unwelcome heat. Maybe a little overdone on the fruit, but well-done overall.",40.0,84,45.5,3.0
2967,Lew Bryson,"Oat, malt, rye, and wheat are the four organic grains (like you, I was instantly curious); nice amber color. Hot and sweet (with a hint of dill) on the nose, rafting in on a thick oak plank. Sweet grain, cut wood, and lingering heat make this good, but I'm looking for more complexity. There's no clear handle to this one, no “I'm bourbon,” or “I'm malt,” which is intriguing, but it's just...good, not inspiring. Odd complaint, but there you are.",50.0,84,47.0,3.0
2970,John Hansell,"A relatively high rye grain content for a bourbon (36%). The port adds richness (fleshy fruit) and helps the whiskey taste older than it really is (by masking some of its youthfulness?). Notes of ripe cherry, soft plum, mandarin orange in syrup, dates, and toffee. The spices (cinnamon, mint, and a dusting of cocoa) pick up mid-palate and finish strong and warming. A slight bit more port than I would prefer, but the spice vibrancy still shines through.",35.0,84,45.5,2.0
2973,Lew Bryson,"Peat-smoked American malt whiskey. Nose isn’t so much peaty-smoky as it is sweet and husky; like cocoa bean mulch that’s been rained on a few times. The smoke’s there on the tongue, though, beautifully restrained, light and sweet. For small-barrel whiskey, this is surprisingly subtle, and the dance of the smoke is enticing. The oak’s a bit sharp though, and clamps on the finish; points off there. Promising.",35.0,84,45.0,3.0
2974,Lew Bryson,"Sweet fresh corn and fruit—apple skins, white grapes, dried apricot—tangle with spicy cinnamon and circus peanuts. Quite smooth indeed, especially at 50%.

A late-morning bourbon, easy and friendly.",35.0,84,50.0,3.0
2975,Lew Bryson,"Hot tropical fruit, warm band-aids, and a mix of Dum-Dum lollipops in the nose. More sweet and creamy on the palate, with a hint of the band-aids, and dry grip of oak at the end. A fairly quick drink, but a clean and layered one.",48.0,84,40.0,3.0
2976,Lew Bryson,"Distilled from 100% white winter wheat; pale straw. Salty dough and sweet, light canned fruit. Like grain whisky on the tongue: light, sweet, delicate, more fruit cocktail, and a hint of milk chocolate. A smooth and pleasant finish. Simple but delightful.",35.0,84,40.0,3.0
2981,Lew Bryson,"Is buckwheat a grain, seed, or nut? Doesn’t matter: you can malt it, so Corsair put it in their rye bourbon as a fourth…whatever. Aromas of corn, vanilla, and teaberry, with a pleasant broadness and light herbal notes. There’s a nutty note to the sweet corn and vanilla, and a move in the direction of astringency, but it’s intriguing, a definite plus. The layered finish has a woody nip to it, that dry earthiness, and sweet corn.",50.0,84,50.0,3.0
2982,Lew Bryson,"Distilled from imperial stout and “vapor infused” with hops, this is a bold example of Darek Bell’s “Alt Whiskeys.” Piney hops, hot toffee, and chocolate notes fill the nose. It’s a long ride on the palate: brisk spice first, then hops and hot malt, a mealy undercurrent that pulls you from a cocoa start to a hot and sweet finish, with a burnt note on the very end. Busy, but consistent.",50.0,84,43.0,3.0
2983,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"There is a rich and robust distillate lurking under all that oak, with chewy maple candies, chocolate-covered cherries, and rhum agricole intensity. The astringent oak does no favors for the heat of this 100-proof whiskey, but with its lingering dark chocolate and char it’s still a bold and tasty rye.",100.0,84,50.0,3.0
2984,Lew Bryson,"A young (“minimum of 6 months”) rye, finished in California vermouth barrels. The results are polarizing; I’m in the “intriguingly tasty” camp. The nose: rye spice with herbal depth and fruit wreathing. The whiskey hits first, but herbal vermouth is right behind, putting more body on the spirit and cranking the finish in an unexpectedly dry, almost bitter direction. An aperitif whiskey, begging to play with cocktails, or even ice, but good neat. Craft whiskey continues to experiment.",45.0,84,47.0,
2985,Lew Bryson,"Sweet nose with a hint of soft-boiled egg, digestive biscuit, and cedar (nowhere near as nasty as it might sound!) Warming orange peel notes, toffee, rye grassiness, a trace of horehound, and light, oaky vanilla make a sweet but somewhat angular mouthful. Finish is a bit edgy and boozy; the weakest link in the glass. A bit of water helps the finish a lot. Nothing sticks out too much; a good whisky. (Canada only.) C$24",23.0,84,40.0,4.0
2989,Lew Bryson,"Darker gold in the glass than regular VO, but sporting that same VO nose of caramel and dry corn. Fuller grain sweetness in the mouth, with some nice light fruitiness—white peach, seckel pear—coming out, and there’s a sweet cinnamon smear along the roof of the mouth. Dries significantly toward the end, and finishes quickly, but with everything in good order.",20.0,84,40.0,4.0
2990,Lew Bryson,"Rich, full, and clean cornbread nose with just a hint of herbal zip; not what I expected at all from a white whiskey with a jokey name and label. Light, vaporous corn glides over the tongue with a hint of fresh grass, easing off the palate to an airy corn finish; a lingering thought of corn. Corn eau de vie, with an accomplished touch on the still; very impressive.",28.0,84,40.0,3.0
2991,Fred Minnick,"At 3 years, 6 months, this whiskey shows so much promise. As most young bourbons do, this one starts with hints of oak and a mouthful of corn that develops into cornbread and corn pudding over subtle hints of pralines and chocolate. Then out of nowhere, raw almonds and pecan shell. The medium finish ends with a touch of cinnamon. High hopes for this one. In another year or two, we could be talking about something really special. Price is per 375 ml.",24.0,84,46.0,2.0
2992,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Limited by its obvious youth on the nose, but the fresh herb chiffonade character offers intrigue, with distinct sage coupled with some chamomile notes. The palate is a step in the right direction, with dark berries, spices, vanilla, and charred marshmallows, although somewhat light bodied and supple in texture. Young, but sweet and honest.",55.0,84,50.0,3.0
2993,Lew Bryson,"Local Montana grains in an impressively brown all-Montana bourbon. Has a small-barrel smell to it—a dry wood and hard candy note I’m starting to recognize—and a snap of rye. Interesting: light but not weak in the mouth. I found their moonshine not that clean, but the wood’s done a good job on it. Rye grass and sweet corn mingle with pepper and anise. Clean finish. (Montana only)",45.0,84,40.0,3.0
2996,Lew Bryson,"One of a series of Berkshire bottlings done in barrels used to age craft beers; this one aged the massive (29%!) and complex Samuel Adams Utopias. The beer barrel adds a depth to Berkshire’s usually brighter character, a rounded and full sweetness with rum and fruit notes. There’s heat and youthful sweetness, and a pleasing fullness that grows toward the warming finish. A nice twist on the usual bottling. (Massachusetts only)",63.0,84,43.0,3.0
2997,Lew Bryson,"Another from a series of beer barrel-finished bourbons from this Massachusetts distiller; this one’s from a Terrapin Brewing’s Monk’s Revenge Belgian IPA barrel. Nose is fruity and sweet, with an undertone of linen and old iron. There is the bitter and faintly piney edge of hops in the whiskey, which adds a cutting grip to the finish. Before that, there is spoonbread, oak, and a hint of anise. Interesting components, needs a bit more integration.",45.0,84,43.0,3.0
3001,Lew Bryson,"Another MGP/LDI-sourced rye, which KGB Spirits then ages additionally at their Alcalde, New Mexico site; it’s tagged as a 15 year old whiskey. An oaky, sweet nose with hot cereal notes. The tongue impact is breathtaking: a hot, thick slam of spice, mint, and wood that cools to a long, sweet mint finish. A bit of water tames it a bit and brings out more oaky notes and more sweetness. Powerful stuff.",90.0,84,45.0,3.0
3002,Lew Bryson,"A 2 year old bourbon made from Texas-grown white corn. It sports a dusty nose full of dry corn and oaky spice. The whiskey is big-boned, juicy and sweet, but with a bitter streak of wood running through it. The finish confirms the youth of the whiskey as it flames in a long, hot wind-up. Some very interesting components here, waiting for better integration.",70.0,84,47.0,3.0
3006,Jonny McCormick,"It will soon be 120 years since this workhorse of a distillery came into being. Golden Grahams, sanded oak, whole lemon, floral blooms, and cumin seeds on the nose, but the whole confection is rather restrained. The palate is sweet, but could be too sweet for some; Scottish tablet, caramel, ripe banana, granulated sugar, and ginger loaf. Some late heat accompanies the sugary finish. Remember to brush your teeth before bed.",76.0,84,48.8,1.0
3010,Lew Bryson,"Crystal clear and colorless. Somewhat rich for unaged corn spirit: corn, baked apple, grass, and a very light honeysuckle syrup. Quite mellow on the tongue; sweet, but with a drying finish of baked grain, sweet dried grass, and finally, just a hint of heat high in the mouth. A pleasant little glass.",25.0,84,43.5,3.0
3017,John Hansell,"A straightforward bourbon with no flaws. Nicely balanced flavors of fruit (mandarin, apricot, pineapple), gentle sweetness  (honey, vanilla, caramel), and soft spice (cinnamon, mint). Gentle finish. Nice enough to drink straight in a pinch, but it comes across as more of a mixing bourbon to me.",22.0,84,40.0,2.0
3018,Lew Bryson,"Distilled from a 10%, 70 IBU barleywine from Blue Point Brewing on Long Island. I’m smelling light pine hop notes, dried spruce plank, and heavy fudge; a muddled, heavy nose. Much better in the mouth: the fudge is restrained, the spruce and hops bring a lightness and verve to things. Not the “single malt” you might be expecting, but very much American craft distilling; like nothing else, intriguing, bold, a bit young, and with a lot of promise. Price is per 375 ml.",45.0,84,47.5,3.0
3019,Lew Bryson,"Sourced whiskey, moved to used bourbon barrels, then finished in barrels that held their Pine Barrens whiskey (also reviewed this issue). Pine sap, sweet juicy berries, and oak aromas; had to re-nose to be sure on that pine. Mouth is relatively smooth, much more so than the Rough Rider bourbon. Picking up some of that Pine Barren fudge, and a touch of rye grassiness. Finish is warm and spicy. A nice young rye.",40.0,84,45.0,3.0
3020,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Just four years ago, two Barrys—Stein and Bernstein—opened the doors of Still Waters distillery on
the northern edge of Toronto. Distinct notes of poached pears, marzipan, flaky halva, and cinnamon apple pie embellish sweet ripe cherries, nutmeg, and a vague earthiness. Oatmeal, dry grain, and hot pepper combine on a sweet, polished palate. C$100",100.0,84,62.3,4.0
3021,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Luscious sweet maltiness underlies a breadth of flavor that belies this whisky’s youth. Hints of acetone, green fruit, and hard pears joust playfully with earthy tones and elements of blue clay. Vague references to mulled red wine center around fleeting cinnamon sticks, ripe red fruit, and the grainy bitterness of buckwheat honey. Rich in grain and grasses, the palate is sweet, oily, and very spicy. Bottling at 46% and not chill filtering should please the anoraks. (Distillery only.) C$70",70.0,84,46.0,
3022,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Ellington has the creamy, sweet, and ultra-smooth mouthfeel down pat. Canada likes its mixing whisky to bite a little, but America prefers a silky smooth glide right down the gullet. Ellington Reserve certainly delivers with its rich, almost oily aura that springs to life with spicy-hot white pepper and newly-split clean firewood. Caramel and brown sugar underscore distinct notes of perfumed, candy-coated licorice amidst fragrant orange blossoms and flat lemon-lime soda. C$17",17.0,84,40.0,4.0
3023,Dave Broom,"I have a soft spot for the Braes: not only a forgotten part of Speyside, but the only distillery whose roof I’ve stood on. Anyway, here you have yeastiness and a smell like just-baked, sugar-topped apple pie, the fruit cracking through warm pastry. Sweet, direct, and slightly nervy, Braes is never going to be a heavy hitter, but this is the ideal dram to conjure up fading memories of summer.",100.0,84,56.9,1.0
3025,Lew Bryson,"Nose is thin and sweet, smelling of popped corn and a bit of oak and vanilla. Mellow and smooth in the mouth, with warm corn and corn syrup notes, more oak and vanilla, but nothing overpoweringly sweet; good balance. Some oak in the finish, a slight curl on the tongue that's not unpleasant. “Single Barrel,” but no barrel number given. Sourced whiskey.",40.0,84,44.45,2.0
3026,Lew Bryson,"“Aged less than 4 years.” Sharp new oak (this is 30-gallon barrel aged), with hot cinnamon and sugar in the nose. Dry, and a bit hot up front, but its wheat comes through in a smoother, sweeter middle and a gentle, warm finish where corn finally appears. No real flaws here; it could be better integrated, but it has a rough appeal.",37.0,84,45.0,3.0
3027,Lew Bryson,"Rye grain, fresh-sawn wood, and a hint of brittle sugar. No corn here: the mashbill is rye, wheat, and malt. Bitter rye edge drives this into the palate, blowing open space for the smoother body to follow and briefly sweeten things up before the rye warp collapses in an oily, spicy, savory finish. Quite discreet and small-scale; this doesn't roar, it urges. Good, but it needs more breadth and wood depth to be great. (Massachusetts only.)",38.0,84,43.0,3.0
3028,Fred Minnick,"This is a non-chill filtered bottling. Initially, it’s perfume-centric with highly floral notes until a grain neutralizer sets in, with hints of caramel and vanilla. Cornbread, honey, and slight hints of pepper, herbs, and tobacco. Finishes short with a mouthful of lovely sweet corn pudding.",40.0,84,46.0,2.0
3030,Lew Bryson,"Another American single malt, from Colorado. A meaty, savory aroma, with molasses cookie and herbal cough drop underneath. Roughly sweet in the mouth, with hints of smoke and bitter chocolate, sweet orange and stewed apples, with a strong back note of anise. For all the strange name and really strange logo (antlers on a barrel?), this is not bad at all.",48.0,84,46.0,3.0
3031,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This is pipeline whisky made to be used in a Highball. That said, Lord Calvert is a solid blend to begin with and this beefed-up version makes all the right noises for cocktails or mixing with ginger ale. Sweet caramels, hot peppers, and hints of dry grain are bolstered by ripe dark fruits and spicy rye. This is simple, well-made whisky that shines best when mixed.",13.0,84,40.0,4.0
3032,Dave Broom,"Amber. A thick nose with touches of fresh varnish and a little oiliness. Has some substance and weight and the heavy florals (lily, jasmine) typical of mature Craig, alongside toffee. The palate is ripe, juicy, and full, the cask adding a slight resinous edge. Appears slightly smoky. Becomes fleshy, even waxy, with water, and decidedly more elegant. The tannins are supple and some herbal notes emerge. It is at its best neat, or with water on the side. £80",123.0,84,48.4,1.0
3033,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in June 1994, this example of Deanston was aged for 20 years in a refill butt, which ultimately yielded 188 bottles. Quite shy on the nose, a hint of starch, gentle malt, and ginger. Shows its true colors on the palate: relatively full-bodied and sweet, with peaches and over-ripe apricots. Softly spiced. The finish is lengthy and sweet, with cocoa powder and sprightly oak. £87",133.0,84,51.7,1.0
3034,Dave Broom,"Pale straw. This is a classic young Caol Ila, all elbows and knees. There is sweetness, but it’s counteracted by this briny edge and an aroma like firelighters in among smoldering peat. Shut your eyes and it could be mezcal. The smoke envelops the palate while you pick out edible seaweed and smoked oyster on the tongue. Very bright and would make a good aperitif/highball. £50",73.0,84,46.0,1.0
3035,Dave Broom,"Huge marzipan/almond notes greet you on the first sniff. This then moves into an aroma like crepe bandage and even a hint of ointment, then lychee and some maltiness. The palate is surprisingly feisty, with a little orange. Water brings out mash tun aromas and a pleasing whiff of sheep pens. When diluted, the palate is very pretty, with the almond returning. Easy drinking. £80",125.0,84,46.0,1.0
3038,Dave Broom,"Another blast of new oak. Fat and creamy, with distinct charred elements along with stewing pineapple, banana fritters, white chocolate, suntan oil, and a melting bar of nut-filled milk chocolate. An instructive dram showing how maturity is very different from age. With water, some of the distillery finally pokes through. To be honest, it’s slightly too much for me; like overdosing on cotton candy or sugar-topped donuts. £54",84.0,84,52.8,1.0
3039,Gavin Smith,"This 2000 vintage expression from Glenturret was matured in refill sherry hogsheads before bottling in 2015 as part of Gordon & MacPhail’s “MacPhail’s Collection” range. The nose is earthy, with vanilla, treacle, and dark berries, plus fruit spices. Full-bodied in the mouth, with spicy, zesty plums, raisins, cocktail cherries, and nutmeg. The finish is lengthy, with black treacle, cocoa powder, and an edge of slightly bitter oak.",60.0,84,43.0,1.0
3040,Gavin Smith,"This peated expression from Tobermory distillery has been aged in refill, remade hogsheads. The nose offers earthy peat, citrus fruit, vanilla, and smoked haddock in butter. Big, sweet peat notes on the peppery palate, with marshmallows and lively spices. The spices linger to the close, with peat embers and a hint of brine on the lips. £60",78.0,84,46.0,1.0
3042,Gavin Smith,"While most Wemyss Malts’ releases are named after flavor descriptors, this one adopts a well-known Shakespearean reference. A sherry butt filled in 2002 gave an out-turn of 854 bottles. The nose offers toffee bonbons, coffee with condensed milk, and finally farmyard aromas. The palate is relatively sweet, with spicy sherry notes and contrasting mildly citric fruit, plus a slight earthiness. The finish is medium to long, with lingering spice and a carry-over of coffee from the nose. £57",96.0,84,46.0,1.0
3043,Lew Bryson,"All four of these Catskill whiskeys are in exceptionally beautiful bottles. Pleasant, homey smell of furniture polish, dried mint and grass, golden syrup, and sweet dough, wrapped in a thin layer of oak. Brightly sweet, more mint and grass, some cashew richness, and an insistent singing thread of oak that broadens to the finish, where the sweet and the oak balance with a new note of melon. A bit of astringency at the end, but this is right decent whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",35.0,84,42.5,3.0
3048,Lew Bryson,"Bottle design looks like it came from a 1950s movie. Did bourbon smell like this then: cornbread and cinnamon, seasoned oak and a bare hint of cedar, sweet hot dough? Oily and lazy on the tongue, a pool of sweet corn fire, touched with the cinnamon. The wood is absent, but returns at the end with a grip on the tongue and palate. Another great whiskey for the money; great on the rocks, from a drawer in a private eye’s desk…",13.0,84,50.0,2.0
3049,Geoffrey Kleinman,"You wouldn’t believe from the nose on this white whiskey that it’s nearly 50% alcohol. Sweet, fresh-milled cornmeal combines with slightly acidic and floral pear, with just a dash of yeast to form an inviting and approachable nose. On the palate it’s equally affable and well-balanced, with sweet corn, crisp pear, and white pepper spice. A nice long finish with a touch of cooling rounds off an expertly-crafted and enjoyable moonshine.",40.0,84,49.5,3.0
3050,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The second whisky from this Canadian craft distillery is a blend of three barrels of 100 percent rye whisky. Maturation for 3½ years in once-used red wine barrels has integrated distinct ripe fruits into the spiciness of rye grain. Youth is obvious in the earthy, malty elements, and the peppery heat, and there are distinct suggestions of clean blue clay. Its full body, rich flavors, and the fruit-spice balance speak well for the future of whisky from 66Gilead. (Canada only)",69.0,84,47.0,4.0
3051,Dave Broom,"Light gold. Fresh and lightly nutty/biscuity combined with a gently swelling aroma of fruit syrups, green grape, lime (or green) jelly babies, and Quetsch, with that nut flour underneath. The palate is similarly smooth, creamy, and upfront, with a decidedly acidic zing to the finish before the wood finally shows its presence. A soft, delicious whisky that ticks all the right boxes but doesn’t really set the world alight. (2,700 bottles)",475.0,84,52.4,1.0
3053,Lew Bryson,"Nose of sweet dried grass and cinnamon, echoed on the palate with supports of sweet, oaky vanilla. The finish develops some doughiness, then finally an oaky spice heat that lingers pleasantly, the most interesting part of the dram. Well-made (at Cedar Ridge, in Iowa) and clean, if not exceptionally complex. A good flask whiskey for a hike. Sourced whiskey.",50.0,84,47.5,
3054,Lew Bryson,"There's big oak, caramel, cinnamon and clove spice, and fresh grain in the nose; not a shy, soft wheat whiskey at all. Good body, supporting spiciness, mint, and young oak; the small barrel punches, tempered by sweet grain and spice. Finish gets a bit dusty and astringent, crimping things. Wood-balanced, not dominated by it. Bold, dynamic.",46.0,84,46.0,3.0
3055,Lew Bryson,"Wigle’s proud to have a full 2 years of age on this organic wheat whiskey. It’s small-barrel dark, but the nose isn’t a ripper: it’s 100 proof hot, but sweet with grain and even light fruity notes (pear and ripe melon). There’s no denying it’s aggressive, especially for a wheat whiskey, but the small-barrel oak blends well with the grain, giving a robust set of flavors: oak, hard candies, grilled fruit. A bit loud, a bit pushy, but endearing.",62.0,84,50.35,3.0
3058,Lew Bryson,"Nose is mild, pleasant, sweet, with rock candy, cinnamon, and baked apple. Follow-through on the palate is almost exact: mild, pleasant, sweet, with rock candy, etc., plus a nice bit of extra alcohol heat and quiet oak shaping the finish. A mild-mannered bourbon, which I feel is like a mild-mannered rodeo bull; out of place. There's nothing wrong, but it's a bit too easy-drinking, too mild. Bulk up.",60.0,84,44.0,3.0
3059,Lew Bryson,"Now that’s something you don’t see every day. Kings County (Brooklyn, N.Y.) used peat-smoked malt in this bourbon. The nose is bonfire and sweet juicy corn; the undiscovered Hebridean Isle of Kentucky? The smoke is less forward on the tongue; you don’t get so much a peaty bourbon as you get an unusually rich, broad young bourbon. More warming corn, digestive biscuits, and a pleasantly hot finish. Compelling, and…what kind of Manhattan would this make? (400 bottles; at the distillery only) Price is per 375 ml.",49.0,84,45.0,3.0
3060,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Sweet vanilla, dried berries, and a soft display of woodsmoke introduce this whiskey. While notably improved from earlier bottlings, the sherry is still rendered a bit dull, like chocolate-covered cherries, as smoky cocoa nibs and the chewy malt meet on the palate, offering a honeyed finish with hints of baking chocolate.",80.0,84,46.0,3.0
3064,Dave Broom,"Full gold. Good cask interaction here, allowing a light tropical fruit element to emerge alongside peach and apricot. Juicy and sweet, in other words, with none of the usual Tormore rigidity. The palate is equally concentrated, showing some heat, with a decent degree of fleshy elegance. Water brings out more dry elements: brown bracken, hayloft. It begins to firm up, but it is good enough to change folks’ minds about this distillery. £125",183.0,84,55.6,1.0
3068,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Cereal grains, flour-dusted breadboard, fresh cut hay, horehound lozenge, and apple pie. The appearance of Fig Newtons cookie and toasted rye bread flavors nicely complements green peppercorn spice and an herb garden edge, with good length to the salted-caramel and sweet maple finish. Pot distilled from 100% Michigan rye and aged in full-sized barrels. It’s just a touch green, but drinking nicely and totally on track. More patience will pay dividends.",60.0,84,49.4,3.0
3069,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in 1985, this expression of Highland Park was matured in a single bourbon cask that yielded 252 bottles. Green apples, tinned mandarin oranges, linseed, and a hint of smoky chocolate on the nose. Sweet spices, coconut, and mild peat smoke on the light palate. Lingering peat smoke, root ginger, and a touch of vanilla in the medium-length finish. £120",191.0,84,48.3,1.0
3070,Dave Broom,"Surprisingly punchy for its age, there’s very little cask activity here, so what you get is a reduction of Caol Ila into oils (lanolin) and whiffs of the harbor (drying fishing nets) rather than overt smokiness. The palate is gentle and shy, with an unctuous feel that drifts into poached pear and light cream. Delicate, but also oozing with character. Best neat.",400.0,84,50.7,
3071,Dave Broom,"This example of the little-seen Glentauchers immediately shows classic distillery character, which is in the green grassy camp. This verdant aspect continues into fresh fruit salad, with enough ripeness to indicate the time spent in cask. This mix of freshness and weight extends onto the tongue, although the impact fades soon after a light spicy tingle on the back palate. I’d happily have a couple.",275.0,84,55.2,1.0
3072,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Although much praised, Potter’s was a mythical distillery. It had no still, but sold whisky purchased from others. This straightforward all-corn whisky shows dusty corncobs on the nose, with sweet and sour sauce, caramel, oak, cinnamon bark, and intriguing hints of pine needles. The palate is broader, beginning with a very sweet and zesty spicy rush, followed by sweet wood, a syrupy mouthfeel tasting of prune, dark ripe fruits, and sour citrus notes. (126 bottles; UK only) £75",110.0,84,56.5,4.0
3075,Gavin Smith,"This single cask bottling from Langside Distillers was aged in a sherry butt and bottled in 2015. Candied orange peel on the early nose, soft sweet sherry, and glacé cherries. Fragrant, with milk chocolate-coated Turkish Delight. Sweet, spicy sherry, plus pepper and cinnamon on the uncomplicated palate. Fruity spices in the medium-length finish. (222 bottles, Robertsons of Pitlochry exclusive) £45",56.0,84,46.0,1.0
3077,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"There is lovely freshness here, with sawn oak, bread dough, and baking spice aromas. Despite the generous 80% rye content, the malt component really comes through, offering good backbone, creamy caramel sweetness, and approachability. A streak of pleasingly peppery rye is balanced with sweet vanilla, leading to a lively finish with mint and chocolate malt balls.",50.0,84,45.0,3.0
3079,Lew Bryson,"A 1 year old whiskey made from rye, wheat, and cherrywood-smoked malt. An interesting sweet/sour nose, with Montmorency cherry, sweet grain, bitter rye, and a slap of fresh leather jacket. Follows through in the mouth, but more integrated, a sweet cocktail of neat whiskey with only the slightest hint of “smoke.” The leather slips in at the finish and wraps things up neatly. A bit overly sweet, a bit simple, but good.",55.0,84,48.0,3.0
3080,Lew Bryson,"100% rye, unmalted and malted, direct-fire pot stilled, “old wood finished”: a detailed label, but no age statement or “straight.” Peppery, minty nose with a fleeting hint of coal smoke, lots of heat. Fierce rye flavor, hot and sweet, and then a fantastic finish that curls and flexes: sweet, oily, hot, pepper, and small barrel oak. The rest of it’s okay, but that finish is a marvelous ride.",65.0,84,54.4,3.0
3081,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A surprisingly tasty “buyers own brand” of unknown origin. Its lush, fruity, caramel-rich nose foreshadows a sweet, mouth-coating luxury. Baskets of orchard fruits and bowls of stewed fruit are accented by cinnamon, mild ginger root, and spicy white pepper. The round, syrupy mouth feel carries right into a creamy but gently bitter, glowing hot finish. Meticulously well-balanced and the very definition of smooth.",25.0,84,40.0,4.0
3086,Lew Bryson,"Made from 100% organic red winter wheat, aged 2 years, 1 month. Much lighter on the nose than its rye stablemate (see above); notes of butterscotch and green tea, with a bit of oaky strength. Flavors of cracked grain and light stone fruits shimmer across the tongue; the oak stays high in the mouth. Finish is light and long, moving from grain to wood at the end. Interesting and delicate for a 2 year old.",65.0,84,45.0,
3087,Lew Bryson,"100% pilsner malt fermented with Belgian ale yeast. Not unaged whiskey; a grain spirit meant to be drunk without aging. Sweet-tart, intense aroma of unripe cherries, plums, white pepper, and a bit of caramel. Smooth on the tongue with a roll of heat, grain comes forward and dominates the fruit, though it balances at the finish. Clean, even interesting. More poitin should be like this. (Pennsylvania and New Jersey only)",28.0,84,48.0,3.0
3089,Dave Broom,"An immediate and perhaps surprising smokiness which brings to mind cask-aged mezcal (tepeztate to be precise), and it is this green, celery-accented element playing off some oily, nutty, and farmyard notes that gives balance and intrigue. Water reveals its youth, but there’s enough cask action to add some weight to the palate, where the natural sweet spirit shows itself. Keenly priced. Worth a look next time you are flying. (Travel Retail exclusive) £68",98.0,84,57.8,1.0
3090,Gavin Smith,"Matured in bourbon casks, this is the second release from the fledgling Caithness Distillery. Clearly youthful on the nose, but not raw, with ginger, melon, and background resin. Ultimately, mildly floral. Chili notes on the relatively dry palate, with nutmeg and spicy oak. The finish is on the short side of medium in length, peppery, and slightly bitter. Once decanted, this dram improves significantly and is rated on that basis. (1,200 bottles)£65",81.0,84,46.0,1.0
3091,Lew Bryson,"A mashbill of 60/20/10/10 corn/wheat/rye/malt, aged 3 years in full-size barrels. Nose is sweet, hot corn, but with an initial puff of sulfur; where’s that from? Interesting splash in the mouth, with smooth wheat character knocking back the rye spice. Fairly hot, with some clove/cinnamon spice amping up as it winds down to the warm finish. Very active whiskey.",65.0,84,47.5,3.0
3092,Lew Bryson,"100% malt whiskey, aged “to taste” in white oak vats (1,000-2,000 gallons!), on toasted cubes of hickory, maple, mulberry, red oak, and grape wood. Pleasantly fruity nose with a firm oak backboard. Malt is dominant on the tongue, a bit shallow, but the woods contribute a bubbling complexity. Unfortunately, things don’t really come together in the finish, but the experiment’s not a loss, given the interesting effects of the multiple woods. Worth a taste.",45.0,84,42.0,3.0
3093,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Soft and sweet; ripe apricot, honeyed porridge, and sweet vanilla take the lead, with a palate that elicits warm peach cobbler sprinkled with brown sugar and cinnamon. There is lots of freshly-sawn oak apparent throughout, but ample fruit keeps this whiskey juicy right through a pleasantly spicy finish. Fruit forward, smooth, and lovely; a real eye-opener for a whiskey of 100% soft white winter wheat. 375ml",42.0,84,45.0,3.0
3095,Dave Broom,"Smoke comes at you immediately, the morning-after smoke of a spent fire, mixing with reeds and rushes, a touch of coconut, and light oak. Water is needed to bring out sweetness alongside the Band-Aid note typical of many young peaty whiskies. The palate is a lot sweeter than the nose suggests, bold and quite thick; honey adding a sticky quality that then moves into creosote and antiseptic cream. It needs hefty degrees of dilution. A work in progress. £100",161.0,84,57.0,1.0
3096,John Hansell,"Caramel corn, vanilla cream, citrus, evergreen, and a peppering of cinnamon. Soft oak finish. Pleasant, straightforward, youthful, and uncomplicated. Would prefer to see it bottled at a higher strength.",27.0,84,40.0,2.0
3099,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"A nice jolt of violets, pepper, and sawn oak on the nose is underscored by some green stick and leafy sassafras notes, turning a bit more dark and chewy on the palate, with caramel, figgy fruit, green peppercorns, and a long and bold finish dominated by dark chocolate. Softens up nicely with water, and reveals more fruitiness.",75.0,84,50.0,3.0
3103,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Herbal, licorice, and cinnamon notes are initially quite alluring, but stifled by a slightly sour note peering through. Still, this is identifiably bourbon, with sweet corn drive, leathery oak, and cocoa coming together nicely before a warming finish of spice candies.",50.0,84,45.0,3.0
3105,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A slightly closed nose opens to pleasing meatiness, then green fruits with hints of evergreen. The palate is sweet and surprisingly rich, although fairly simple. Strong peppery spices and something pleasantly vegetal creep in. Slowly, the sweetness becomes unctuous, turning an otherwise fine sipping whisky into a mixer. Brisk spices provide a counterpoint to the sweetness, but the balance seems off. Some structure finally develops around suggestions of dark chocolate.",20.0,84,40.0,4.0
3109,Fred Minnick,"Florals and fruit begin a soft and delicate journey. For such a light whiskey, it’s certainly heavy on cherries, stone fruit, apples, and marmalade, followed by toffee, coffee, bananas, and chocolate. A drop of water shows how delicate it is, and the short finish suggests this whiskey would be leaps and bounds better with ten more degrees of proof.",12.0,84,40.0,2.0
3110,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Seems to show good maturity on the nose, with nutty, herbal, woody, and husky grain aromas. The notes of warm porridge with brown sugar portend the sweet palate, almost cloying with ripe red fruits. Warm, chocolaty, and spicy, but the somewhat hot finish and dusty oak floorboard quality don’t leave the best lasting impression.",40.0,84,46.0,3.0
3111,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A mash of 95% local rye and 5% malted barley is distilled on the grain, then matured for 3-plus years in new, custom toasted, full-sized bourbon barrels. Expect loads of vanilla and bold barrel notes over dry grass and nutty clean grain. Despite the hot, spicy intensity, lovely mild sweet lemon notes come right to the front. Bottled barrel by barrel, so expect some minor variability. Look for a red stripe on the label. (Canada only) $60 CAD",47.0,84,45.0,4.0
3112,Davin de Kergommeaux,"It is unfortunate that Glenora does not mark lot numbers, as each succeeding batch improves over previous ones. Gone are the soapy notes that oozed out of the bottle, keeping early releases from showing their strength. While the nose is big, on the palate the whisky becomes light, with brisk spiciness, some malt, and subtle oak. Glen Breton is known for its red apple notes and gentle flowers. To these now add pepper, honey, caramel, and light oak.",83.0,83,43.0,4.0
3113,John Hansell,"Fruity on the nose and palate (orange peel, lime, lemon, pineapple). Very smooth and creamy, too, with notes of vanilla and a touch of honey. Underlying brittle mint, delicate floral notes, and even a hint of sandalwood gives the whisky some dimension. Very clean and nicely rounded. The problem with many Canadian whiskies is that they are too harsh when young, but get too woody when aged for ten or more years, because they are too thin in body to stand up to the oak. This one has matured nicely while still maintaining good balance and drinkability.",26.0,83,40.0,4.0
3115,John Hansell,"This soft, bright, easy-going whisky is back in the U.S. after being absent for several years. Very fragrant, with vibrant fruit (nectarine, plum, guava, pineapple, clementine), honeyed vanilla, and subtle macadamia. Fairly light (a pre-dinner or leisurely afternoon malt, perhaps?), but evenly balanced. A gentle introduction to single malts for the blended scotch drinker.",43.0,83,40.0,
3123,John Hansell,"Gentle in personality and predominantly sweet, with notes of honeyed vanilla, caramel, maple syrup, coconut cream pie, and a hint of red licorice. Underlying bright fruit, suggestions of green tea, and a dusting of cinnamon keep the whiskey lively and upbeat. A soft, toasted oak finish tames the sweetness and provides balance. The whiskey is more approachable and easier to drink than a typical bourbon containing rye-the spicy rye intensity isn’t there. Some bourbon enthusiasts will miss the challenge-and rewards-that the rye would normally provide. For this reason, this whiskey will be more appealing to drinkers of wheated bourbons (e.g., Maker’s Mark, Old Fitzgerald, W.L. Weller). It is an interesting change of pace from the standard bourbon fare, and it is a unique exploration of American whiskey without sacrificing authenticity.",40.0,83,45.0,2.0
3124,John Hansell,"Placed in a new barrel after 8 years and 8 months. Very spicy with an oak sappiness. Loads of maple syrup and corn sweetness up front, with the spice and some subtle lush fruit kicking in mid-palate. Leather and tobacco follow through to a very masculine, dry oak finish. While a very enjoyable whiskey, the dominant, hot, and lingering oak on the finish keeps me from scoring it as high as its siblings.",50.0,83,45.0,2.0
3125,John Hansell,"Aged in Zinfandel barrels for eight years after spending ten years in new charred oak. Quite similar in flavor profile, but with more oak influence (as would be expected) when compared to its younger brother. The oak spices and resinous textures are more prominent on the nose and palate in this whiskey, and they linger on the finish, which ultimately becomes slightly leathery and tannic. Still, an entertaining, intriguing whiskey. (But read between the lines-buy the younger expression.)",50.0,83,45.0,2.0
3126,John Hansell,"Light and airy on the nose, and delicately creamy on the palate. Gently sweet personality, with caramel custard, vanilla bean, candy corn, and crème brulee. Shows more oak on the palate than the nose, with increasing dried spice notes on the finish. A peculiar whiskey, if not overly complex or inspiring.Price is per 375 ml.",46.0,83,45.0,2.0
3127,John Hansell,"There’s a reason why bourbon distillers don’t char their barrels to this intensity. Aged over 15 years, this is a bold whiskey, with lovely honeyed fruit and creamy vanilla on the nose and palate. But it’s bullied by the charred oak, brandishing oak tannins and leather, along with background tobacco and over-roasted nuts. Dry, charred oak finish. There’s a lovely sweetness that does challenge all this charred oak, but it eventually loses the battle. Price is per 375ml.",47.0,83,45.0,2.0
3128,John Hansell,"A soft, delicate bourbon -- especially when compared to its single barrel siblings here. Subtle notes of candied fruit and creamy sweet notes (vanilla, coconut, light toffee, and caramel corn) are nicely interwoven. Some integrated, gently-dried spice dances throughout and lingers on the finish. An easy-to-embrace bourbon with nice balance.",30.0,83,45.0,2.0
3129,John Hansell,"The most aggressive of the bunch, with the wood playing a dominant role. Toffee, rummy molasses, roasted nuts, barrel char, leather, tobacco, and a wisp of smoke.",20.0,83,45.0,2.0
3130,John Hansell,"Clean and uncomplicated bourbon. Creamy sweet layers of vanilla, caramel, and toffee are underpinned by soft citrus fruit, gentle mint, teaberry, and delicate oak. Here’s a bourbon certainly good enough to drink on its own, but you won’t feel guilty throwing it in a mixed drink. Nice for everyday drinking.",25.0,83,45.0,2.0
3131,John Hansell,"One of the biggest Birthday Bourbons to date. This whiskey was aged on the top corner of a warehouse where the temperature extremes are at their greatest. The greater the temperature extreme, the greater the impact of the barrel. The wood is immediately noticeable on the nose and palate-there are plenty of concentrated dried spice notes throughout. Dried vanilla, mint, fiery cinnamon, cedar, and assorted fruits are sweetened and calmed by notes of maple syrup and toffee. Until about mid-palate, that is. Then, another wave of dried spices kicks in, remaining through the finish. For serious bourbon drinkers.",40.0,83,48.0,2.0
3132,John Hansell,"A very hearty Birthday Bourbon. Richly textured with lush sweet notes of jammy berried fruit, coconut cream pie, and apple crisp, married with firm dry notes of fresh mint, warming cinnamon, and vanilla. Dry, polished leather finish. The oak-influenced dryness on the finish lingers longer than I would like, and the flavors aren’t integrated as well as last year’s version (which is understandable, given that last year’s release was Malt Advocate magazine’s American Whiskey of the Year). This is certainly an entertaining whisky. Save it for after dinner, though.",40.0,83,47.0,
3133,Dominic Roskrow,"Ardmore is a rising star in the world of single malt. Until four years ago it was little known in its own right, its main purpose being as a key malt in Teacher’s. Then Ardmore Traditional was released, and it’s been winning over drinkers ever since. That malt is a delicatessen whisky: smoky, oily, and savory, a unique Highland malt with much to recommend it. This is a different proposition altogether. It’s clean and sweet, with pineapple candy, dusty and almost incense-like spices, and a liberal dose of sweet peat. Some citrus notes, too. The peat holds out until the end with impressive effect. There’s talk of this becoming a permanent part of the Ardmore portfolio. Let’s hope so: it’s further proof that Ardmore is a very interesting distillery indeed. (Travel Retail and selected specialist whisky shops.)",195.0,83,51.4,
3134,John Hansell,"Rich, good body, blueberry muffin, black cherry, a lot of tannic grip (perhaps a little too much for balance). Not as polished as the Pomerol or Madeira.",80.0,83,50.0,1.0
3135,Gavin Smith,"Arran distillery has been making peated batches of spirit since 2004, and this NAS bottling is the fifth release of that spirit, peated to 20 ppm. The outturn is 12,000 bottles. Nutty peat, spicy malt, toffee, and lemon on the mildly savory nose. Vibrant on the palate, with lots of citrus fruit. A bonfire smokiness develops steadily, with spice, nuts, and plain chocolate through to the relatively long finish, which features a persistent citric note.",62.0,83,46.0,1.0
3136,John Hansell,"A very textural whisky. Incredibly creamy, with mouth-coating vanilla, honeyed barley, hay, linseed oil, clementine, and subtle peach. The whisky continues to cling to the palate long after the finish. It’s what you would expect Auchentoshan to taste like, but bolder. A nice whisky, but lacking the polish of the standard 21 year old expression.",120.0,83,53.7,1.0
3137,Gavin Smith,"American Oak is new to the Auchentoshan core range in 2014 and is the first release from this Lowland distillery to be matured solely in first-fill bourbon casks. An initial note of rosewater, then Madeira, vanilla, developing musky peaches, and icing sugar. Spicy fresh fruit on the palate, chili notes, and more Madeira and vanilla. The finish is medium in length, and spicy to the end.",40.0,83,40.0,1.0
3138,Gavin Smith,"The Bourbon Matured variant of Balblair’s two Travel Retail expressions of its 2004 vintage is available on a worldwide basis. Light and delicate on the initial nose, with ripe pear, melon, lemon, watery toffee, and hints of honey and ginger. Sweet orchard fruits on the palate, with developing cinnamon, coconut, and crème brûlée. Tingling spices in the finish, with slightly drying oak.",74.0,83,46.0,1.0
3139,John Hansell,"The tell-tale rich honeyed Balvenie personality is spiced up by finishing it off in new charred oak casks, making a normally masculine whisky even bigger. The honeyed malt impacts the palate first, with intermediate notes of citrus fruit, followed by dried spices (cinnamon, vanilla, ginger, and cocoa). The new oak impact is most evident on the whisky’s long, dry, spicy finish. A nice whisky, but perhaps a tad too much new oak for greatness?",90.0,83,43.0,1.0
3140,John Hansell,"Good, straightforward, moderately sherried Balvenie. Classic honeyed notes combine with vanilla, ripe barley, glazed citrus, apricot marmalade, cinnamon, and nutmeg. A nice entry level Balvenie, a solid effort.",55.0,83,43.0,1.0
3141,John Hansell,"Very fruity and spicy. High, bright fruit notes of lemon, mandarin, and mango, with a sprinkling of ginger and powdered vanilla. Oak kicks in on the end, leading to a fairly dry finish, which is not surprising for a 30 year old whisky.",225.0,83,43.5,
3142,John Hansell,"Finished in a dark rum cask. Notes of peat, smoked mackerel, and suggestions of charcoal married with molasses, vanilla wafer, golden raisin, cantaloupe, and a dollop of honey. It’s missing the more defined fruit notes that the other two have. I’d like to see this at 15 years to give it more depth.",85.0,83,46.0,1.0

3144,John Hansell,"Lovely golden honey color. Lush and sweet (the Sauternes impact is obvious), with honey-drenched apricot, sultana, and lemon gum drops. Vanilla, candied nuts, and subtle botanicals round out the palate. Decent oak grip on the finish keeps the whisky from being too cloying.",113.0,83,46.0,1.0
3145,Dave Broom,"A venerable bottling from its proprietor, and there’s no doubt from the nose that you’re dealing with an ultra-mature whisky. Like going in to meet your aged grandfather who is sitting in his library surrounded by old books, with a little sunlight filtering through the drapes. In time, there’s dried peach and envelope gum. The palate is wooded and concentrated, but it is dry and lacking in the required energy. Water stirs it into life, but kills the flavor. £450",690.0,83,42.5,1.0
3146,John Hansell,"The only distillery-approved bottling of Bladnoch in the United States. When compared to the Gordon & MacPhail bottling above, this one isn’t as sweet or creamy in texture. There’s more citrus fruit and a drier, spicier finish. This one is also bolder and a bit more aggressive.",110.0,83,55.8,1.0
3147,John Hansell,"Aged for six years in bourbon casks, then aged an additional ten years in Bordeaux wine casks. Classic Bowmore peat smoke and red berried fruit (raspberry, strawberry) are the main components of this whisky, with additional notes of plum, grape skin tannins, currant, caramel, and marzipan. Good grip from the Limousin oak (wine casks). Some brine and damp cellar notes emerged occasionally, with the smoke lingering long on the finish.",120.0,83,53.5,1.0
3148,John Hansell,"Aged in a used bourbon barrel. Rather soft for Bowmore — especially for its age — with a gentle foundation of honey, vanilla, and malt. Interwoven notes of summer fruit, coconut, lime, and gentle peat, with teasing brine and smoke on the finish. A straightforward, unpretentious, pleasant Bowmore.",55.0,83,46.0,1.0
3149,John Hansell,"Finished in Madeira casks. An interesting contrast to the 15 year old. This one is more challenging than soothing (and quite dry too -- especially on the palate), with dominant red fruit (currant, raspberry, strawberry), plum, baked cinnamon apple, polished leather, bourbon, almonds, and just the hint of smoke and brine. Dry, resinous finish. An intense Laddie.",170.0,83,46.0,1.0
3150,John Hansell,"A departure from the first edition of Bruichladdich 20 year old, and very Glenmorangie-esque-given that it was aged for five weeks in Mourvedre wine casks before being bottled. The wine influence is evident, both in appearance (a pinkish hue), its palate (berry fruits), and even its nickname (""flirtation""). It is quite a sweet Bruichladdich, with chewy toffee, ripe berries, background pit fruits, and earthy/ resinous spicy notes-especially on the finish. A Bruichladdich fresh Islay sea breeze character fights its way through, but it is a struggle.",170.0,83,46.0,1.0
3151,John Hansell,"A very fruity “Laddie,” flowing with tangerine, apricot, pineapple and pear. Background notes of honey, vanilla, and a wisp of smoke. The typical Bruichladdich fresh, appetizing, brine notes are restrained, emerging ever so subtly on the finish. Nicely rounded and clean throughout.",180.0,83,54.4,
3152,John Hansell,"A replacement to the original 10 year old, which is now off the market. A clean, straightforward dram with a lightness and freshness which is very inviting. Notes of vanilla cream, light caramel, tropical fruit (coconut, pineapple), clementine, pear, and a hint of currant. Appetizing, subtly briny finish.",60.0,83,46.0,1.0
3153,John Hansell,"Finished in a rum cask. Gold with a greenish tinge. Notes of ripe barley, demerara sugar, toasted marshmallow, and sultana, with underlying vanilla and subtle brine emerging on the finish. A pleasant, easy-going Laddie. (Bottled for Bayway World of Liquor)",50.0,83,46.0,1.0
3154,John Hansell,"The 8th in a series of “Links” releases. This one’s further enhanced in Chateau Latour Bordeaux casks. Bright, fruity notes of red raspberry, rhubarb, and candy apple. Teasing fresh brine emerges occasionally, along with citrus, mango, and vanilla. A very perky whisky.",85.0,83,46.0,1.0
3155,Dave Broom,"The second bottling from Bruichladdich in this range shows the ‘traditional‘ side of a distillery that is famed for the variety of its expressions. This, in other words, is Bruichladdich in its sweet, honeyed, gentle guise partnered with American oak to produce a mashed banana character, an unctuous palate, and a light touch of almond on the finish. Lovely. £55 (500 ml)",88.0,83,49.3,1.0
3156,Dave Broom,"The Micro Provenance series is Bruichladdich’s web-exclusive range of single cask bottlings. This is made from barley grown on Rockside Farm (now owned by Kilchoman) and has been aged in virgin oak. The oak doesn’t dominate the nose, allowing fresh cereal sweetness to develop, along with an estery lift and some jasmine/meadowsweet florals. The palate is where creamy vanilla and white chocolate show through. Fresh, balanced, and bottled at the right time. (468 bottles) £90",117.0,83,63.6,1.0
3157,Dave Broom,"Our second Bunna’, this is pale of hue with a surprising hint of salinity alongside a whiff of lemon sherbet, and an aroma like wet linen, while a floury maltiness runs below. Age however has twisted the fruits into the verge of musty over-ripeness. It’s explosive and spicy and, even though this is only 46%, it is hot. Water picks up the acidity before there’s a huge hit of warming ginger as the kiss-off.  £89",138.0,83,46.0,1.0
3158,Dave Broom,"Very chewy. Think of melting Mars bars, with a touch of coconut cream, then red-fruit acidity, red cherry, and lemon. All very forward and sweet, but with no alcohol when neat, showing an active cask. Dilute, there’s coconut, pea shoots, and banoffie pie. The palate is thick with Jaffa cake (orange and chocolate), then nutty granola. It doesn’t take water too well. Quite fat. £50/500 ml",84.0,83,56.9,
3159,John Hansell,"One of a series of single cask, wine-finished Caol Ilas. This one is finished in a claret (Bordeaux) wine cask. The claret adds some bright red fruit notes (raspberry, red currant) and red licorice to accompany the smoke, brine, olive, and vanilla-laced malt. I have tasted some claret/Bordeaux wood-finished whiskies where the wine was too dominant, but this one achieves a nice balance.",85.0,83,46.0,1.0
3160,John Hansell,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Pale gold Aroma: Surprisingly fresh and clean. Golden raisins, lightly oaky. Malted barley. Palate: Beautifully balanced and clean.

3161,John Hansell,"Very pale in color, suggesting it was aged in a used bourbon cask. One nosing confirms it. A fairly light, fresh, and appetizing whisky, with notes of brine, mustard seed, and delicate honeyed vanilla. Slightly oily in texture. Seaweed, with suggestions of ginger and bourbon on the finish. An aperitif whisky, or with sushi perhaps? (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)",45.0,83,46.0,1.0
3162,John Hansell,"Aged in bourbon and sherry casks, and then finished off in oloroso sherry casks for two years. The sherry provides a good measure of lush fruit, brown sugar, and a slick texture on the palate. The sherry is clean and uncluttered, if somewhat overshadowing the traditional Deanston honeyed malt foundation. I’m also picking up some burnt marmalade, lemongrass, and ginger. Soft, sweet, fruity, finish.",265.0,83,46.7,1.0
3163,Gavin Smith,"This 18 year old was matured in refill hogsheads before a period of finishing in first-fill bourbon casks. It is non-chill filtered. The nose is light and fruity with pears, melon, and mild vanilla, plus caramel and a hint of toffee. Rich and full on the textured palate, with big orchard fruits, honey, buttery spice notes, then emerging aniseed. Dries in the finish, with plain chocolate and slightly tannic oak notes, plus a sprinkling of chili heat.",135.0,83,46.3,1.0

3165,John Hansell,"I don’t normally like to add water to old whiskies, but this one needs a little at this strength. Whether you will like this whisky or not depends on whether you like woody whiskies with lots of sherry, and whether you care at all about recognizing the distillery character. The flavors are nicely balanced, rich, and very soothing in nature, but I struggle to find Glen Grant in here. Ripe fallen fruit, chewy toffee, maple syrup, honey-glazed almonds, damp oak resins-it’s all there, and it’s all balanced and quite entertaining. I personally want to taste the distillery character in my whisky. If that didn’t matter to me, I would have given this whisky a higher score.",155.0,83,,1.0
3166,John Hansell,"Like many older Glen Grant offerings, this one is from a sherry cask. The sherry, and the long oak aging, transforms what is normally a light and easy drinking whisky to a more serious affair. Ripe, heavy fruit dominate the palate-the sherry is very evident here, but it is not cloying. It’s quite nutty too, along with polished oak and toffee. The oak balances the sherry notes very nicely, and the whisky is clean and uncomplicated throughout, all the way through to its finish.",160.0,83,53.6,1.0
3167,Dave Broom,"As this is slightly closed when neat, you have to search for Glen Grant’s classic apple notes behind a tense nose which, even with water, remains inward-looking. Thankfully, this changes on the tongue with pure, very linear (typical of GG) flavors of cool mint, cucumber, basil, and yes, apple. Easy-going from a relaxed cask, but with more substance than you’d expect.",100.0,83,55.8,1.0
3168,Gavin Smith,"Oloroso Finish has spent 16 months gaining additional maturation in oloroso casks. The use of sherry wood has lent the nose a greater sweetness, with vanilla, dates, apples, and cinnamon.

The fruity finish is of medium length, with mixed spices and white pepper. £45",73.0,83,46.0,1.0
3169,Gavin Smith,"A 22 year old Glencadam; maturation took place in a refill American oak hogshead. The nose offers rich honey and malt notes, though slightly balsamic.

3170,John Hansell,"An interesting whisky, with flavor notes I wouldn’t normally find together-golden raisins, green grapes, plum, citrus tang, fresh ginger, almonds, and a hint of mint leaves, all wrapped by a pleasing maltiness with underlying notes of vanilla custard. Fairly dry, slightly hot finish. Many of the Glendronachs (especially from the distillery) are sherried. Some of the sherried versions, like the 33 year old, are excellent. However, this is a refreshing change of pace. I’m glad they bottled it when they did though, as any additional oak dryness would be detrimental.",210.0,83,46.0,1.0
3171,Dominic Roskrow,"This whisky is doddery and on the edge, bordering on feeble. You have to look hard to find its spark and fire, but if you search for it, it is there. The nose is light and savory, with crushed fall leaves and chestnut on the nose. On the palate, there are traces of licorice stick, a touch of cumin, anise, and a creamier, less bitter chocolate note than some other samples. It finishes with traces of mandarin, but overall the sun is setting and the spirited and energetic man of old seems to be getting bitter. Overall, though, still pretty impressive for its age. £380",592.0,83,48.8,
3172,Dominic Roskrow,"This is the most seasonal of this batch of GlenDronachs, with a nose of rich stewed prunes and fermenting fruit in an orchard at harvest time.

3173,John Hansell,"Clean, fragrant, and quite fruity, with notes of tangerine, lemon, pineapple, and kiwi. There's a creamy-almost oily-vanilla maltiness on the palate that binds the fruit together. Gently dry, subtly spicy finish. A pleasing, unpretentious whisky.",36.0,83,40.0,1.0
3174,Dave Broom,"Second of this pair of limited editions from Glenfiddich. This was named after a number of the distillery’s warehouse roofs collapsed under the weight of snow in 2010. This was a bottling of a selection of casks — ex-sherry, ex-bourbon, refill — from one of those damaged warehouses. It is gentle and sweet — cooked pear, fruit crumble topped with rolled oats, golden syrup, and on the palate hints of raisin. A lemon finish adds a freshness to a dangerously drinkable dram.",90.0,83,47.6,1.0

3176,John Hansell,"Very frail. Don’t add any water to this whisky, as its flavors seem to crumble. It’s a subtle whisky too -- one has to tease the flavors out of it. But when you do, with some focus, you’ll find fragrant notes of dried spice, malty vanilla, citrus peal, and elegant floral notes. Surprisingly, the whisky is not overly dry and woody on the palate. The initial impression of this whisky is that it’s too tired and past its prime. With continued exploration and patience, its subtle pleasures emerge.",900.0,83,41.7,1.0
3177,John Hansell,"Glenkinchie goes from 10 to 12 years old. I think the two years have done it good. It’s deeper, more complex, with better flavor development. Notes of fresh cut grass, vanilla, bright lemon, and cinnamon, with a soft malt underbelly.

3178,John Hansell,"Its deep amber/ruby color suggests a lot of sherry, and one whiff confirms. The whisky is rich and sappy in texture, with lush notes of ripe sherry fruit balanced by dry, mature spicy oak. There’s a pleasant soothing texture to the whisky too, but I do struggle to find the subtle complexities which make some bottlings of Glenlivet so special.

All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The youngest of the quintet has been aged in refill sherry hogsheads, but the coconut that immediately assails the nostrils suggests they were made from American oak. Alongside this is the distillery’s signature pineapple note which sits under a scented, floral lift. Water adds a further layer of ripe pear. The palate is equally heightened with a powdery feel. It’s pretty discreet and I’d be cautious with any dilution. The finish is a mix of night-scented stocks, custard, and green apple. £95",156.0,83,54.4,1.0
3180,Dave Broom,"Bottling of a large package of 12 butts and 30 hoggies dating from 1972. The nose is slightly closed initially, but shows good mature distillery character: old apple, potpourri, more raspberry, and furniture polish. The palate is a little dry, with humidor and light chocolate, but needs water to bring out the fruit-sugar sweetness. It’s good, but that low bottling strength has sapped it of the energy which is vital for old whiskies. (U.S. only)",700.0,83,40.0,1.0
3181,Dave Broom,"The aim here was to recreate the style of malt made by George Smith, but rather than running peated malt, Chivas Bros. has aged the spirit in Islay casks (not what George would have done). On the upside, this is a classic Nadurra: estery fruits with pineapple to the fore, freesia, pear, and fresh apple, the smoke giving subtle gun-flint notes to the palate. I like it as a dram, but it’s wimped out of what was intended. Marked accordingly.",89.0,83,61.5,1.0
3182,Dave Broom,"A typical Rothes nose, with vanilla, granola, apple, Brazil nut, lemon, and
low-level sweet spices mixing with lightly oxidized fruits. That said, it needs
water, especially for the palate, where the malty crispness of the undiluted
taste is replaced by something more considered, darkly fruity and gently spicy;
coriander is uppermost. All in all, this is Rothes in very approachable rather
than dynamic guise. One for a lazy afternoon.",67.0,83,43.0,1.0
3183,Gavin Smith,"Principally matured in bourbon casks, this expression has undergone a finishing period in sherry casks. Sweet wood polish on the nose, with brief pineapple juice notes and rosehip syrup. Smooth and fruity on the palate, with vanilla, spicy milk chocolate, sultanas, and some earthiness. The finish is medium in length, with sherry and a tang of bitter orange. £47",73.0,83,46.0,1.0
3184,John Hansell,"Pleasant aroma (subtle, but with nice depth), with notes of honeyed lime, kiwi, chopped nuts, chocolate fudge, and gentle, seasoned tobacco. Everything is working nicely on the palate too, with a similar flavor profile (the nuts now being roasted) and some smoldering smoke, until about mid-palate, when its age becomes evident with some wet wood notes blending in the mix through to the finish.

3186,Gavin Smith,"Originally exclusive to the Swedish market, this expression was selected by Highland Park’s Danish brand ambassador Martin Markvardsen. Matured in a combination of 70% bourbon barrels and 30% oloroso sherry casks. Waxy and malty on the early nose, with fresh earth, damp moss, vanilla, and honey. Gentle peat on the palate, more earthy notes; herbal, with lime and salt. The finish is quite short, showing apricots, slight peatiness, allspice.",90.0,83,46.0,1.0
3187,Dave Broom,"The news that there’s a new distillery being built on the Imperial site is something to be celebrated. One hopes that the new plant makes whisky of the same character as the old, because Imperial is a classic single malt which is about fragrance (here pineapple and toasted marshmallows) and a clinging, seductive, cream soda quality. Whiskies like these are poems, they need you to concentrate. This is a touch rigid, but that’s a minor criticism of a gorgeous dram.  £60",93.0,83,46.0,1.0
3188,Gavin Smith,"The nose offers less rich, peachy fruit than the 12 year old. More perfumed, with toasted marshmallows.

3189,Dave Broom,"Typically pale and slightly broader than in previous years, with a little more fleshiness that rubs alongside squid ink and white pepper. Huge smoke mingles with the sharp tang of brine and a touch of bran. Water brings out lanolin. There’s little oak getting in the way of the distillery character here and while water settles the waves, it just doesn’t have the extra dimension that elevates the decent to the great. It does make a great highball tho’. (31,428 bottles)",130.0,83,54.4,1.0
3190,John Hansell,"Tastes more mature than its age would suggest. It’s packed with ripe, sweet barley (especially at the palate entry).

3191,John Hansell,"Tobermory’s peated offering. Great to see Ledaig hitting its stride, with a brisk punch of peat and not chill-filtered. There’s a bit of a raw edge too, quite bracing but still plenty of soothing sweetness. Earthy peat smoke, ripe barley, honeyed vanilla, bourbon barrel char, black licorice stick, espresso bean, olive brine, and suggestions of beef jerky. In some respects, it even tastes younger than 10 years old, but I’m balancing that with bonus points for distinctiveness.",49.0,83,46.3,1.0
3192,John Hansell,"Spicy and botanical on the nose, with notes of ginger, juniper, lemon grass, orange, and grapefruit rind. Similar follow-through on the palate, with added notes of vanilla, honeyed malt, and hay. Gentle, dried herb and spice finish. Certainly some interesting -- perhaps even peculiar -- flavors from this product of the demolished Lowland distillery.",220.0,83,63.5,1.0
3193,Dave Broom,"A catch-up rather than a new release, but a fascinating contrast to the 14 year old Flora & Fauna bottling. Yes, there’s apple blossom, but here there’s more medlar, fruit syrups, raspberry, and an intriguing play between vanilla and lightly oxidized nuttiness. Linkwood’s substance is shown on the palate, where an oily feel adds texture to the lush dried fruits and saffron-led spiciness. Best neat. An elegant dram.",80.0,83,43.0,1.0
3194,Gavin Smith,"Matured in a refill hogshead, the out-turn was 262 bottles. The nose is malty, with the oiliness of figs, plus dates and tinned peaches.

3195,John Hansell,"Antique gold color. Fruity aroma with delicate notes of spice (anise, eucalyptus). More fruit on the palate-soft in texture and gently sweet-with interwoven fresh spice notes and a pleasing rounded finish. A gentle, medium-bodied dram.",76.0,83,46.0,1.0
3196,John Hansell,"A combination of 6, 10, and 14 year old Longrow. I was concerned that there would be too much young whisky in here (like there was with the Springbank C.V. several years ago), but this isn’t the case. Youthful? Yes. Immature? No. A Longrow with an attitude. Creamy, sweeter vanilla notes up front, with kiln smoke, sea-soaked stone, tar, anise, chocolate fudge, and apricot. I would like to see more of the older whisky in here, because it leans towards the young side, but it is still a vibrant, enjoyable whisky.",75.0,83,46.0,1.0
3197,John Hansell,"A nicely clean Longmorn, expressing floral notes (especially violets) and bright fruit (lemon, lime, cantelope, plums), supported interwoven notes of honey, rich malt, bread pudding, dates and vanilla. The classic Longmorn viscosity is there, and this thickness is tamed by a very pleasing spicy, dry oak finish, with a hint of salt. I could drink this stuff anytime. G&M’s move to 46% has certainly benefited this whisky. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)",65.0,83,46.0,1.0
3198,Dave Broom,"Longmorn is one of Speyside’s fruit bombs, something which remains true here, even if in slightly paler guise than usual. Instead of ripe autumn fruits, here you get kiwi, William pear, green plum, even green tomato, and a faint blossom reminiscent of the almond notes of sakura (cherry blossom). I’d keep water well away, such is this light, lacy Longmorn’s fragility. £73",121.0,83,48.1,1.0
3199,Dave Broom,"Oak-driven, with cream and butterscotch dominating the nose initially. Then there’s black cherry, and coriander seed frying in butter. The weighty distillate adds depth, but not specific flavors. The palate is all coconut cream, cream toffee, then Longmorn’s cooked plum density comes in. I’d have preferred the oak to be scaled back, allowing the distillate to show, but if you’re looking for a scotch made for bourbon lovers, then go no further.",190.0,83,51.6,1.0
3200,John Hansell,"Aged in a refill butt, and very pale in color. Very fragrant -- fruity and spicy -- with notes of vanilla, lemongrass, ginger, sultana, citrus zest, key lime, and green grapes. There’s a floral component, too (rose petals?). A very delicate Macallan, and quite suitable as an aperitif. (749 bottles produced.)",70.0,83,46.0,
3201,John Hansell,"A nicely honeyed malty foundation is balanced by fruit on the front of the palate, with a pleasingly dry, spicy finish. It would benefit by being bottled at 43%, like the older two expressions. It is simple, straight-forward, and unpretentious, as one would expect in a 10 year old whisky.",44.0,83,40.0,1.0
3202,John Hansell,"Full gold. Oily in texture, with ripe barley, front-loaded toffee, honey-drenched citrus, fallen orchard fruit, and a full complement of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, and clove). Gripping, resinous, slightly hot finish. The flavors don’t meld together here as well as the other three expressions, but it’s still a fun ride. (Price is per 1 liter).",90.0,83,,1.0
3203,Dave Broom,"With the hue of pigeon blood (a ruby, not a dead bird), initially this seems closed, but richness develops, mixing stewed Assam tea, chocolate biscuit, raisin, damson jam, and a whiff of tomato puree. The oak gives it the character of a Barolo Chinato. A knife and fork are needed to consume it, but for all the big tannins, there’s dark rose petal and the bittersweet edge of licorice. Dry, rich, and hermetic. For the hardcore sherry lover. 145 bottles.",,83,59.6,1.0
3204,Dave Broom,"Soft fruits are to the fore here; think of cooking green plums, fruit syrup, a hint of sultana to add to the sweetness, and then a hint of beeswax. There’s even a little of Macallan’s occasional earthiness, here akin to the damp sand floor of a sherry bodega. This is the transition point in the range with a similar weight to Gold but greater sweetness and the beginnings of Macallan’s mysterious savory edge. Have neat, with water, or ice. £45",70.0,83,40.0,1.0
3205,Dave Broom,"Clean with the warming, sensual aroma of yeasty freshness that you get from freshly-baked bread. Stir in some almond butter, a little hay. The palate shows that it has substance behind this very open nose. Here is thickness, tongue-clinging oils, and a vibrant lemon note bringing to mind boiled travel sweets, before the dry maltiness comes through. With water — and it’s best lightly diluted — we’re looking at pastries. £36",56.0,83,40.0,1.0
3206,Dave Broom,"Bottled at 350ml. as a pair with a Spanish oak version (and probably sold out at source), here you get the merest glimpse of Macallan’s meatiness (shepherd’s pie) before flowers and apple blossom take charge. Lifted, yes, but never delicate. Water brings out cereal and mealy pudding, with barley sugar on the end. £350",567.0,83,58.1,1.0
3207,Dave Broom,"The Darkness! series involves finishing in specially-made octave (50-liter) casks. This has positive Macallan character with some oil (putty even) and touches of malt and turned earth, but also a scented, cognac-like fruitiness with added spice. Water adds a little sherried cheesiness. The palate shows some nutty, oxidized flavors to begin with, but then in the middle the PX flumps onto the tongue, slowing and dampening the drive. Pleasant enough though. £110/500 ml",185.0,83,52.3,1.0

Miltonduff was licensed in 1824, and these days is also an important blender’s malt with a little more oily depth than its neighbor, Glenburgie. This has a deep floral bouquet — think iris and lily — and aromatic fruits like quince. With water there’s moss, sage, and orange peel.

3211,John Hansell,"A marriage of whiskies from bourbon, sherry, and port casks, which does help give it some complexity. A bit fleshy on the nose (sooty peat, soy sauce, sherry, tannins). It calms down on the palate (and is soothed by the sherry notes), with some additional vanilla, bitter orange, and brine. More brine and warming pepper on the finish. There’s a lot going on here, which I like, but I’m not sure all the flavors dovetail with each other well enough to deserve a higher rating.",40.0,83,46.0,1.0
3212,John Hansell,"A new expression in the portfolio. Quite fruity, with prominent honey-tinged citrus peel, nutty toffee, nougat, and vanilla fudge, leading to a gripping, firm, dry oak resin finish. Deeper and bolder than the 12 year old expression.",40.0,83,43.0,1.0
3213,Gavin Smith,"This is Tomatin’s first cask strength offering, and is also non-chill filtered. The initial batch of 15,000 bottles was released in February, and was matured in a mix of oloroso and bourbon casks.

The wet grain and green apple are still there, with the bitter fringe of rye crisping things nicely. Pure rye High West spirit, no oak, and you see where this may go.

Here it is at a slightly contradictory midpoint. The nose is fragrant and fruity: apricots, stewed apple, and yes, lemon; and, with water, a hint of smoke. The palate meanwhile shows more of the earthy depth and sloe berry richness that will slowly emerge. A pleasing dram, nonetheless. £75",119.0,83,46.0,1.0
3225,Dave Broom,"Light gold with a very fresh and slightly ozonic nose that brings to mind Thai herbs: lemongrass, galangal, as well as lime. Just slightly nippy when neat. The palate is equally intense, but with a central sweetness. Water cuts down this razor-sharp intensity, adding a softer mid-palate texture, while the finish remains slightly mineraly. A decent aperitif Bunna. £97",154.0,83,46.0,1.0
3226,Dave Broom,"Yes, it’s another 1991 Bunna from Wemyss, so check the name when purchasing. This one has a distinctly smoky element alongside the marine note which they both share.

3250,Dave Broom,"Poor old Speyburn. An unfairly overlooked malt simply because of its (too low) price. The use of more active casks here gives an almost waxed crayon nose, along with some sweet depth. In time, there are fresh green fruits, raspberry mousse, and beautiful floral intensity.

3266,Lew Bryson,"Smells sweet and minty, with gobs of oak and corn…and that’s about how it tastes, too. The corn sweetness and the mint are dominant, but warming oak spice wraps it loosely. It’s called “Young Bourbon” (labeled as “age under 4 years”), and that’s just what it tastes like, as some green youthful notes muscle their way in toward the finish. A bit of a rough-rider, but tasty.",35.0,83,46.0,3.0
3269,Lew Bryson,"A 2:1 blend of rye and “hand-malted barley” lightly smoked with fruitwood, aged with apple and oak wood chips in used bourbon barrels, finished in another used bourbon barrel, aged 12 months total. Was it worth it? A good rye smell, with fruit notes; quite appealing. Relatively smooth, and the smoke comes through quickly, with sweet pepper spice and vanilla. Not overly complex, but well-made and pleasant.",46.0,83,45.0,3.0
3274,Lew Bryson,"Organic rye, all grown on the Myer farm in the Finger Lakes by John Myer himself. 100% rye, converted with enzymes; the Myers do everything in-house. Nose is bent with rye oiliness and a faint peppermint brightness. In the mouth it’s rye bitterness all the way through, a crisp, fresh-chewed mint in a mouthful of sweet grassiness, and then a very quick finish: wham, bam, and gone. Simple and clean; could add depth and polish.",45.0,83,45.0,3.0
3275,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Sweet candy nose and a sour rye palate. Tropical fruit and orange zest, with sweet golden sultanas, sour apricot strudel, and Jujubes on the nose follow through to the palate, where they are joined by oak caramel, vanilla, and dusty grain. Peppery spices linger throughout. Wraps up with clean grain, pepper, and sweetish fruits. (Canada only) $23 CAD",17.0,83,40.0,4.0
3281,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Distilled from a mash of malted two-row Canadian barley, and matured indoors for exactly 1,221 days in a first-fill bourbon barrel, Cask 8 is glowingly warm with soaring notes of acetone and sweet esters on a base redolent of linseed oil, gunnysacks, and grassy cereals. The palate is sweetish, like gummy bears, and very spicy. Pepper, ginger, and hot cinnamon bathe in a weighty, creamy body. A longish finish shows soft, oaky barrel notes.

3282,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This mingling of Still Waters’ own mature corn, rye, and malt whiskies with undisclosed, sourced base whisky is sweeter and punchier than the Stalk & Barrel White Label blend it replaces. Clear malt notes, soft caramels, apple juice, and mild sweet flowers on the nose. The palate shows oak caramels, vanilla, and some mild white pepper. Becomes very zesty in the mouth, with a long, peppery, pulling finish. A pleasing but fairly simple whisky, more for mixing than sipping. C$33",26.0,83,40.0,4.0
3283,Davin de Kergommeaux,"They call it cowboy whisky: Smallish bottlers, mostly in the western U.S., buy custom-blended bulk whisky from Canada to release under their own label. This one has enough cachet to find its way back north and into the Canadian market. Sweet and smooth with rich buttery caramels, searing pepper, sizzling ginger, and slatey, dusty rye. Rich dark fruits on the palate turn to zesty citrus notes, then cleansing pith as one sip slowly dissolves into the next. C$25",25.0,83,40.0,4.0
3284,Lew Bryson,"A 100% rye whiskey, made from rye grown about 30 miles from Mississippi River Distilling. Strongly spicy and oily rye character reaching out of the glass and grabbing my nose; some surprising pastry and molasses notes hiding in there. The 40% mildness is disappointing at first, but develops into a spicy, minty mouth-filler with a cleanly sweet finish. On the sweet side, would prefer it drier.",37.0,83,40.0,3.0
3285,Lew Bryson,"Sweet corn and oak, with some green apple and grass notes; a light, pleasant nose that goes hot closer to the surface. Quite light and young in the mouth, clean, with understated oak notes; not taxing or tiring, and a long finish of teaberry and mint. Nothing amazing or overly complex, but a clean, pleasant sip of whiskey. Sourced whiskey.",33.0,83,42.5,3.0
3286,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Distiller Colin Schmidt is earning his blending chops honestly, using sourced whiskies to keep the cash flow positive while his own distillate matures. Sweet burned wood underpins rich dried fruit, hints of crisp oak, butterscotch pudding, and sour gooseberries.

It’s like summer love: fun, but shallow and over quickly. Sourced whiskey.",17.0,83,40.0,
3288,Lew Bryson,"“Spirits distilled from grain and sugar” on the label, and the word “whiskey” is nowhere to be seen, but we’ve stretched the definition before; and this stuff tasted okay unaged.

Sippable, and likely to make a good Old-Fashioned as well.",50.0,83,46.0,3.0
3291,Dave Broom,"The first thing to note is the strength. It’s surprisingly not that hot initially, rather there are hints of soft orchard fruits, gentle smoke, and seashells. With water, the fruits show up—mango and peach—but the alcohol is still masking things. Water goes in immediately to produce a palate that is cool, slightly sweet, with seashore notes, wet stones, and those fruits, but there’s still a real tension to the whole experience.

3292,Gavin Smith,"This 17 year old refill hogshead-matured expression of Dalmore was distilled in May 1997, and 237 bottles have been released. It is an interesting example of Dalmore uncut, without the proprietary sherry maturation-spin usually put on it. The nose is sweet, with caramel, tinned peaches and pineapple, and a smearing of honey. Zesty spices open the palate, which becomes nutty, with Jaffa oranges, gingery oak, and dark chocolate. Long and warming in the finish, with more oak and plain chocolate. £78",119.0,83,55.5,1.0
3293,Dave Broom,"Pale straw. Light but intense, with some pollen, dusty fruits, baked apple. Water brings out an aroma like a fruit orchard in springtime.

Medicine chests, sweet smoke, ginger, and apple on the nose, with damp earth. The palate provides a big hit of peaty spice, seaweed, black pepper, ginger, and dark berries. Becoming slightly bitter in the drying, ashy, medium-length finish. (349 bottles) £48",69.0,83,48.4,1.0
3296,Geoffrey Kleinman,"From an undisclosed Speyside distillery. The nose is extraordinarily yeasty, with distinct apple cider backed by light caramel. The palate is more integrated than the nose with oak and cinnamon spice, apple, honey, and malt. At first these flavors are well balanced, but a spice and heat blast in the mid-palate throws things off. The finish reflects this and is quite dry. The parts are better than the whole in an interesting and strong whisky.  (U.S. only)",90.0,83,56.3,1.0
3297,Gavin Smith,"Bottled at 8 years of age as part of Exclusive Malts’ U.S. Batch 5, this is a relatively youthful expression of the peated Ledaig spirit produced at Tobermory distillery. The nose is full-on and vibrant, with seaweed, brine, peat, black pepper, and new leather. The palate opens with a big punch of spicy peat, then sweet cereal notes and more black pepper. Hot smoke and spice in the medium-length finish, with a hint of coal.",90.0,83,57.6,1.0
3298,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Matured solely in refill sherry casks, this whisky has a light, fruit-forward nose with nectarine, honey, malt, and a touch of spice. The entry is softer than you’d expect for the proof and it presents the fruit at the nose, along with salt and a dash of black pepper. The spice takes over in the mid-palate along with some heat, really throwing off the balance established in the entry. A light finish closes out a slightly disjointed taste experience.

3299,Gavin Smith,"Matured in refill, remade American hogsheads, this 1998 bottling from Tobermory on the Isle of Mull is of the peated Ledaig variant.

The finish is medium in length, nutty, with citrus fruits. (Exclusive to Robertson’s, Pitlochry, Perthshire) £50",73.0,83,46.0,1.0
3303,John Hansell,"One year older than last year’s 20 year old release, (which I felt was on the precipice of being over-oaked) and the extra year is evident. On the nose, the whiskey is nicely balanced. The palate tells a different story, with soft vanilla, honey, caramel, dried fruit, and cinnamon segueing into dominant leather, tobacco, and resinous oak on a long, dry finish. I fear bottling this whiskey annually, one year older, is going in the wrong direction.",100.0,83,45.15,2.0
3304,Lew Bryson,"Fresh grains and sawn oak on the nose, with some green grass and stalks. Spicy, fresh flavors of corn and oak, along with a doughy softness that contrasts with the 48% ABV heat. There’s a somewhat bosky note of leaves and duff, a salty cracker component, and a medicinal hint; the almost herbal complexity I’ve come to expect from Coppersea. Interesting, tasty, well off the beaten bourbon path.",100.0,83,48.0,3.0
3305,Lew Bryson,"New distillery in Lancaster, Penn. “Locally sourced” grain, copper pot still, unaged. Rich new-make smell, warm, full grain, rye oil, and anise. Light spirit: sweet, more grain and a character like pizzelles; sweet crisp anise cookies. Easily enjoyed, with a finish of more sweet grain and anise. Interestingly schnapps-like, given the area’s German roots.",32.0,83,40.0,3.0
3306,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"The nose of this mahogany-hued ‘single-malt’ portends dense and chewy flavors of brown sugar, dates, and toasted walnuts. It’s a bit fiery on the palate, where it unleashes a rush of dried fruits, smoke, and spice. While some raw spirit character peeks through, this unconventional whiskey holds appeal for its originality, with a stout-like crescendo of coffee and mocha on the very long finish.",30.0,83,46.0,
3308,Gavin Smith,"An 18 year old single malt for just $33 should set alarm bells ringing. But this sherry-finished Kirkland expression from an undisclosed distillery is definitely a decent dram at a bargain-basement price. Initially slightly vegetal and earthy on the nose, developing a warm leatheriness, with sherry, figs, melon skin, and caramel. Silky on the palate, with milk chocolate, emerging hazelnuts, sweet sherry, and honey. The finish is medium in length, with spicy orange and mocha coffee notes.",33.0,83,40.0,
3310,Lew Bryson,"Sharp nose, a bit of heat, fresh ground/cracked spices—cinnamon, pepper, allspice—and hot sugar about to caramelize. There’s nothing soft here. The first crash on the tongue isn’t soft either; it’s rushing bonded heat, insistent pepper, and dry oak. Wait a bit, and it calms as you finally find the corn and the mouth widens, then slides into a dryer, lasting finish. Pretty wild ride for a wheated bourbon.",15.0,83,50.0,2.0

3312,Lew Bryson,"Strong, bold aromas of rye grain, fruit (raspberries, black grapes), and dry cinnamon. Punchy rye on the tongue, starts 42% tame but quickly catches fire, roaring toward a barnburner of a finish. As the fire dies down, you find cocoa and rye oil in the embers. This young (12 month) rye is small-barrel shouty, but the roots are good. Solid effort.",45.0,83,42.0,3.0
3315,Gavin Smith,"Distilled in February 2005. Earthy peat, brine, vanilla, cereal, and a hint of cinnamon on the confident nose. Finally, wood smoke.

3317,Geoffrey Kleinman,"The nose features strong rye spice accompanied by sharp, young oak along with black pepper, graphite, and a touch of green apple. The entry is much heavier and sweeter than you’d expect from such a young whiskey. Things quickly change in the mid-palate with a spice blast of cinnamon, black pepper, rye, and oak. A solid dash of heat gives the mid-palate some kick and drives a short, dry finish. Some nice ideas hampered by the reality of youth.",50.0,83,45.0,3.0
3318,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A non-age stated single malt from Washington State. Light amber in color, there’s more oak on the nose than you’d expect, along with baked apple, chocolate, cinnamon, and clove. Chocolate leads the entry, followed by clove, cinnamon, baked apple, and salt. A spicy mid-palate picks up some ginger and a dash of heat. The finish is fairly short and dry.

3319,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Heavy caramel, hints of pansies, dustiness, warming spices, gentle pepper, and bushels of fruit. The amontillado sherry finish gives a tannic red wine feel without much wineyness. About that finish: rather than “rejuvenating” barrels by pouring in sherry and swishing it around before adding the whisky, sherry was blended directly with mature 8 year old Canadian rye, which then spent two months in American oak barrels.

3322,Lew Bryson,"The base bottling of the “new” I.W. Harper from Diageo. Source is “new” Bernheim; no age given. Nose is simple: hard candy and corn.

Table bourbon, though a bit pricey for that.",35.0,83,41.0,2.0
3323,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This odd bird illustrates the yin-yang plight of the craft distiller. Pablum, sweet mash, grain dust, dry green hay, and linseed oil imbued with melon bespeak a telltale immature nose, while the palate, rich in grapes, peaches, and exotic tropical fruits, laced with hot cinnamon, allspice, and pepper, denotes maturity.

Does the experiment support this general concept? Yes, with the sweet spot being the middle floor.

A much deeper, bolder, spicier, drier, and (at times) harsher bourbon when compared to the other two in this experiment, aged on the first and fifth floor. The wood influence (notes of barrel char, leather, and tannin) from the barrel dominate the pleasing sweet and fruit notes found in the other two.

It’s big and rounded and, for me, just lacking the definition and complexity of the Port Wood. For sweeter tooths (teeth?) perhaps.",212.0,82,40.0,1.0
3363,Gavin Smith,"Initially mulch and damp undergrowth on the nose, with a whiff of sulfur. Then developing soft toffee and vanilla notes, though the ‘outdoors’ odor remains. Big and oily in the mouth, with a chewy texture. Oak, citrus fruit, hazelnuts, and spices, plus a hint of gunpowder tea. Medium to long in the finish, with more oak, ginger, and quite bitter coffee. A typically ‘off the rails’ independent Ben Nevis. Great if you have a soft spot for a ‘bad boy!’",90.0,82,46.0,1.0
3364,Dave Broom,"Another Benrinnes from the UK bottler’s new range, here the finish is more forceful, with masses of raisined sweetness, blueberry syrup, and molasses. The Benrinnes character adds weight and a firm earthy base, but this is more cask driven, slightly grippy, and for all the richness of the PX cask, the end result is a little bitter because of the treacle/molasses note. Fun certainly, but a bit over the top. £60/500 ml",101.0,82,53.5,1.0
3365,John Hansell,"Invigorating and youthful, with a raw edge to it. Challenging notes of creosote, charred oak, and earthy peat fire dominate, with underlying ripe barley, honey, and caramel apple. Aggressive, but not over the top.",75.0,82,46.0,1.0
3366,John Hansell,"This cask-strength whisky turns cloudy with the addition of water. Nice balance of both moderate sherry and smoke, with underlying fruit gum drops, shortbread, charcoal, black licorice, and subtle herbs. An assertive whiskey. The flavors aren’t as crisp as I would like, but pretty good for seven years old. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot)",50.0,82,58.6,1.0
3367,Gavin Smith,"Maturation for this 21 year old bottling of Bladnoch occurred in a refill American oak hogshead. Sweet orchard fruits, new-mown hay, malt, and soft toffee on the nose. The palate is initially fruity, with more malt, then nuttiness develops, with aniseed and black pepper. The finish is relatively short and tannic. (U.S. only)",150.0,82,48.1,
3368,Dave Broom,"Light and very creamy, with very subtle smoke in the background, this is like eating a white chocolate ice cream while walking toward a distant beach barbecue. The palate is gentle and sweet with good, refreshing saline balance. Water brings out mint. It’s just a little too tight and disconnected on the tongue.",88.0,82,57.5,1.0
3369,John Hansell,"Aged half in used bourbon barrels, half in refill sherry casks. Thicker, more viscous, and with much more depth than the other three Bruichladdichs reviewed here. The whisky oozes syrupy vanilla, marshmallow, caramel, and marzipan, accentuated by coconut and other tropical fruits. Bruichladdich's signature freshness and brine emerges, but oh, so subtly. It finishes firmly dry and oaky, thanks to all those years in wood. Initially this helps to cut some of the sweetish viscosity of this whisky, but it lingers a bit too long for my palate. I would like to have tried this whisky a few (or perhaps even several) years back.",465.0,82,,1.0
3370,John Hansell,"The most heavily peated of the three (35ppm phenol), but rather gentle for such smoke intensity. No doubt this is partly due to its sweet underbelly of vanilla cream puff, honeyed barley, and melon fruit. The other factor is that the smoke influence is not medicinal like some other Islay whiskies, but rather more of a leafy bonfire smoke, with burning embers and teasing brine on the finish. Like Waves, Peat comes across as a bit youthful.",65.0,82,46.0,1.0
3371,Dave Broom,"Using this ancient barley variety is a challenge for a distiller. The yields are low, the mash thick and hard to work, but I’m delighted that Bruichladdich has persevered. It adds a more overt cereal note to the whisky, taking the Laddie off into a different world of honey-nut corn flakes. There’s also a surprising rose-like perfume. It’s young, so add water to cut its more, er, bracing qualities. In fact, have it with ice and soda. (Travel Retail exclusive) £58",75.0,82,50.0,1.0
3372,John Hansell,"Notes of smoked olives and an earthy peatiness wrapped inside layers of sweetness (honey, caramel and light toffee). The whisky is laced with seaweed and pepper for added zest, with a long smoky and peppery finish. It shows enough maturity, yet it is young enough to let the true Caol Ila character shine through. I would like to have seen this whisky bottled at a higher strength and not chill-filtered.",60.0,82,40.0,1.0
3373,John Hansell,"Beautiful complex fruit on the nose. Tannic grip on the palate -- especially on the finish. The tell-tale orange marmalade combines notes of orchard fruit, caramel apple, fried pineapple, banana nut bread, unsweetened chocolate, grape skin, and plain toast, peppered with cinnamon and ground espresso bean. Distinctive and evolving on the palate -- and humming along quite nicely -- until the oak turns a bit austere and aggressive on the finish. For this reason, it’s my least favorite of the range.",,82,42.0,1.0
3374,Gavin Smith,"This 1995 vintage is exclusively available from Whisky Shop in the UK. The whisky was selected by distillery manager Ian Mackay and his team, and matured in Matusalem sherry and American white oak casks. 1,800 bottles are available. Worn leather, candied orange, malt, and cinnamon on the nose. Spicy orange, sherry, mixed nuts, and licorice on the palate. The finish is slowly drying, with dark chocolate and smoky caramel notes. £85",135.0,82,40.0,1.0
3375,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Remarkably pale in color, this Exclusive Malt is a rare peated Dalmore. Peat reads more funky barnyard than smoke on the nose, with just a touch of sweetness behind it. The taste is much better than the smell, with the addition of smoke to the peat, intertwined with honey, salt, citrus, and ginger spice. The finish is slightly acidic and dry, far less satisfying than the mid-palate. There’s a reason why Dalmore doesn’t peat, but this release is still fascinating. (U.S. only)",100.0,82,53.5,1.0
3376,Gavin Smith,"Initial maturation of Valour takes place in first-fill bourbon casks, before a period in 30 year old Matusalem oloroso sherry butts from Gonzales Byass. Finally it is transferred to port pipes from the Duoro region of Portugal. The nose is floral, with sherry notes, ripe oranges, and marzipan, while the palate offers dark sherry, with bitter orange, contrasting chocolate-coated fudge, and gingersnaps. The finish is medium to long, with lively spices and berry bitterness. (Travel Retail only) Price is per liter.",72.0,82,40.0,1.0
3377,John Hansell,"Bottling at a higher proof without chill-filtering has improved the whisky, amplifying its subtle flavors. Antique gold color. The flavors are bright and fresh, with notes of citrus, pineapple, lemongrass, and subtle ginger, all on a bed of clean honeyed malt, light toffee and soft vanilla. Gentle, easy-going finish. A pleasant “any time of the day” dram.",55.0,82,46.3,1.0
3378,John Hansell,"Finished in virgin oak casks, so I would expect to find some wood influence here somewhere. Indeed I do, particularly on the finish. There’s no age statement, but on the nose it comes across as a bit youthful. Honeyed vanilla, lemon, pear, fresh-cut grass, and wood shavings on the nose. More of the same on the palate, with sweet notes to the fore, and virgin oak influence (wood shavings, polished leather, and a firm oak grip). Very individualistic, but the flavors don’t seem fully integrated. (Perhaps a bit more aging in non-virgin casks?)",32.0,82,46.3,1.0
3379,Gavin Smith,"This cask strength bottling has been matured in oloroso sherry casks. The nose offers old leather and a slightly vegetal note, along with ginger and developing toffee. The palate features unexpectedly dry sherry, rapidly giving treacle, plain chocolate, and dark spices. Hot spices, with black pepper and raisins in the lengthy finish.",180.0,82,55.3,1.0
3380,John Hansell,"A “straight from the cask” bottling, finished in a Grand Arôme rum barrel. I can really pick up the rum. If you’ve ever had rum from La Reunion island (easiest to find in France), you immediately pick it out here. Peculiar straw gold/lime green color. Intriguing on the palate, too: botanicals, fennel, liqueur-ish, honeyed malt, red licorice, and tropical fruit. Sort of like a cross between a scotch and something Benedictine monks would make. A nice change of pace. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)",90.0,82,57.5,1.0
3381,John Hansell,"Here’s a whisky not seen very often in the U.S. When it is seen, it’s from one of the independent bottlers. I have always felt that younger Glen Grant whiskies make a nice introduction to the single malt category-especially for a blend drinker trading up. The whisky is usually light to medium in body and uncomplicated-with no harsh edges to be particularly offensive. And so it is with this whisky. A soft, cereal grain maltiness marries nicely with floral, delicately fruity notes throughout. Gentle, dry but malty finish, with suggestions of shortbread cookies and vanilla. A nice representation of a younger Glen Grant. The flavors are clean and tight.",65.0,82,,
3382,Dominic Roskrow,"Four years ago Glen Grant was in a sorry state, its beautiful gardens in need of some love and attention, its malts neglected and seemingly unloved. Then Campari bought it and we have heard very little more since. That’s until now. With a new visitor center, the gardens in full bloom, and the owners determined to make it a major player, things are looking up. This limited edition 170th anniversary bottling is made up of vintages stretching back to the 70s. They include a couple of sherry butts and some peated spirit. The result is a rich malt with some buttery toffee notes at first, distinctive lemon and green apple notes, and a touch of aniseed. Midway through, it sets off in a more feisty direction, with some peat, sharp spice, and green banana skin. Beguiling and unusual, it’s a statement of intent from an iconic distillery — watch this space. (Selected specialist outlets, excluding the U.S.)",125.0,82,48.0,1.0
3383,John Hansell,"Initially fresh and briny -- the Campbeltown signature being quite evident -- leading to chewy toffee, nutty notes. The brine emerges again -- this time with a hint of seaweed and smoke, followed by another wave of chewy toffee and nuts. The flavors stubbornly refuse to integrate fully, coming across on the palate individually and independently. Sort of like consecutive solos, rather than harmony.",65.0,82,43.0,1.0
3384,Gavin Smith,"This Glencadam variant has been finished for 20 months in ruby port pipes. The result is a whisky that departs from its younger stablemate by offering a nose of rose petals, milk chocolate, stewed rhubarb, sweet red wine, and black pepper. The same ‘new paper’ note survives, however. Viscous on the palate; initially strawberries, then spicy milk chocolate, caramel, and candied cherries. Remaining sweet in the finish, with nutmeg and darker chocolate notes. £35",56.0,82,46.0,1.0
3385,Dominic Roskrow,"No doubt about it, we’re at the furthest outpost of GlenDronach’s territory here, and this particular cask has waved the white flag. It has a dense, sappy, and nutty nose which is very savory and not particularly attractive. But thankfully there’s more to welcome you on the palate, with some rich orange and red fruit and sweet candy providing balance to the savory notes, and gentle oak and hazelnuts also getting a look in. The finish is woody and pruney. £185",288.0,82,51.2,1.0
3386,Gavin Smith,"The first widely-available single malt from the revived distillery of Glenglassaugh, Revival comprises spirit from both first and refill casks, finished in first-fill oloroso sherry butts for a period of six months. Initially a little mashy, with beer-like aromas. Quite sweet and mildly sherried, with developing roasted malt notes, ginger, hazelnuts, and caramel. Leather and insistent spice on the palate, majoring in nutmeg and cinnamon. Straightforward in the finish; spicy and nutty. Probably a crackerjack in another dozen years!",55.0,82,46.0,1.0
3387,Gavin Smith,"A relatively heavily-peated variant of Glenglassaugh matured in 50-liter octave casks, giving significant cask influence due to the high surface-to-volume ratio. This expression is non-chill filtered. Carbolic soap and a mineral note on the softly smoky nose, followed by apple pie and cream notes. The palate is medium-sweet and quite spicy, with black pepper. Now clear, dry peat notes present themselves with a touch of chili. Ashy peat and cinnamon in the medium-length finish. £55",72.0,82,44.0,1.0
3388,Dave Broom,"I’m a fan of the original Nadurra’s freshness, which maximizes Glenlivet’s apple blossom and pineapple perfume. This pleasantly funky new brother has been matured wholly in oloroso, which adds (very) sweet sherry, nougat, blackcurrant, grilled pear, and malt. While the palate starts well, with mixed red and black fruits (and a little grapefruit), the sherry adds thickness from back palate on and the distillery slides away. Pleasant, but a tale of two halves. (Travel Retail exclusive) £50",84.0,82,48.0,1.0
3389,Dave Broom,"This new NAS might surprise those who recall the Chivas Bros. “Age Matters” campaign, but that’s whisky for you. The initial impression is of a fresh maltiness, sweet hay, and fresh porridge oats, then comes sawn oak, but it opens into pineapple, becoming more obviously Glenlivet. The palate is pretty and light, but seems a bit hollow in the middle, making the whole package slightly insubstantial. Water enhances and sweetens the nose, but deepens that mid-palate hole. £30",44.0,82,40.0,1.0
3390,John Hansell,"Firm on the palate and quite mature. Good balance with malty-toffee notes accented by dried oak spices. Additional notes of roasted nuts, tobacco, Earl Grey tea, sandalwood, and a hint of peat and bacon fat. (260 bottles produced.)",90.0,82,,
3391,John Hansell,"Style: Speyside single malt scotch Color: Bright gold Aroma: Fresh cut grass. Damp grist. Vanilla, marshmallow, and banana. Palate: Sweet malt initially, then quickly becoming dry, oaky, grassy, and spicy. Big, long, dry, spicy finish.",150.0,82,46.0,1.0
3392,John Hansell,"The newest whisky in the regular stable of wood-finished whiskies for Glenmorangie. Very fruity-sometimes reminiscent of overripe fruit; other times cooked fruit. In the mix, there’s maple syrup, plum, almonds, and sweet barley notes. The whisky is peppered with spicy notes of toasted oak, cinnamon and vanilla. A whisky that is lush on the nose, chewy on the palate, with a finish of dried spices for balance. This whisky takes some getting used to, and it’s not an every day whisky. You’ll have to be in the right mood for it.",65.0,82,43.0,1.0
3393,John Hansell,"Very much in the Glenrothes style, with a viscous texture that clings to the palate. Very perfumed and fragrant, too, with flavors of assorted dried fruit, vanilla, golden raisin, citrus, and honey that dry quickly on the palate. A suggestion of peat lingers in the background and on the whisky’s clinging finish.",60.0,82,46.0,1.0
3394,Dave Broom,"Light gold. From a refill bourbon cask, here we have more marzipan and some light maltiness alongside very fresh fruit and delicate vanilla. This is Rothes in slightly lean and hungry mode, with its signature fruits and spices in the background. Needs water to smooth things out. When that happens, there’s lemon drizzle cake, leafiness, and walnut flour. A little short on the finish.  £90",151.0,82,49.4,1.0
3395,Gavin Smith,"This expression comprises peated Glenturret malt (55ppm) and some older unpeated Glenturret malt. The distillery has been making peated malt for six years. There is a higher proportion of peated malt in this revised edition than in the previous version. Farmyard aromas on the nose, with an overlay of digestive biscuits and subtle smokiness. Light-bodied, with watery toffee and emerging peat smoke. Medium-length in the finish, spicy, with cigarette smoke. £47",73.0,82,46.0,
3396,Gavin Smith,"Matured in a combination of first-fill Spanish oak sherry butts, refill American oak hogsheads, and first-fill bourbon barrels. The nose is initially savory, with salted caramels, oak, vanilla, and toffee. Medium-bodied, with brittle toffee and spicy fruit on the creamy palate, where more savory notes emerge. A hint of bourbon in the softly spiced, herbal finish, which darkens to black coffee. £47",73.0,82,46.0,1.0
3397,John Hansell,"Honey, vanilla, heather, and citrus are the major components of this Highland Park, with a hint of youthful peat in the background.

(A Bayway World of Liquor exclusive.)",70.0,82,43.0,1.0
3398,John Hansell,"Aged in a bourbon cask. This is a big, vibrantly fruity whisky (lemon, lime, orange, grape), with background notes of anise, fat barley, and vanilla. An unusual and often difficult to find dram. (Bottled exclusively for “Wine on the 9”.)",115.0,82,56.6,1.0
3399,John Hansell,"An interesting comparison to the Mackillop’s Choice expression reviewed above. This is also a big, bold whisky from the currently mothballed Imperial distillery. This one is less fruity. Instead it is quite sweet with a ripe maltiness up front-and rather viscous in texture-becoming dry, slightly austere, and spicy on the finish, with a wisp of smoke.

3400,Dave Broom,"You could argue that there’s an element of auto-suggestion at work when you pick up saltiness in Inchgower, after all, it comes from a fishing port (Buckie). But taste it blind and there it is — an unmistakable salinity on nose and palate which, when combined with lemon accents, cumin seed, thin fruit syrups, and green grapes, makes this an intense, perfect, aperitif. £37 (Not available in the U.S.)",59.0,82,43.0,1.0
3401,Gavin Smith,"Matured in a mixture of bourbon, refill, and recharred casks. Ripe peaches, malt, and vanilla on the nose, with a hint of linseed oil.

3403,Dave Broom,"A new, no age statement addition to the Laphroaig family that blends together Quarter Cask, PX, Triple Wood, and 10 year old. The nose is reminiscent of freshly-treated decking, before some classic iodine creeps in. Water brings out geranium, pollen, and damp leather. The palate is simple, clean, and mild (and smoky), with bay leaf, light dried fruit, and that oily wood. Undoubtedly there's a lot going on, but it’s not married, and 40% means it lacks the necessary wallop. £35",59.0,82,40.0,1.0
3404,John Hansell,"Lochside closed in 1992 and its whisky will become increasingly difficult to find. Very fragrant and quite fruity, with lemon, raspberry, red currant, and plum on the nose. It starts out clean and fruity on the palate too, with a gentle maltiness, but this is quickly taken over by dominant toffee and caramel. A nice Lochside whisky, which could have been even better with a little less toffee on the finish.",100.0,82,50.0,1.0
3405,John Hansell,"When compared to Craiglodge, reviewed above, this whisky is more intensely smoky, tarry, and youthful on the palate. The other flavors, while in the same vein as Craiglodge, are more reserved (or perhaps more greatly overshadowed by the peat). If your intent is full-throttle peat, this is your whisky. If you want variety on the palate, go for the Craiglodge.",65.0,82,45.0,1.0
3406,John Hansell,"This peated expression of Springbank is fresh, powerful, and unbridled. A brief, gristy, sweet malt intro quickly becomes quite aggressive, with an attack of tar, damp peat, kippers, mustard seed, Spanish olives, and Poire Williams. The sweetness emerges again briefly, before succumbing to an assertive, fiery finish.",120.0,82,50.0,
3407,Dave Broom,"With Longmorn, you are always looking for a dense, sweet fruitiness. This doesn’t disappoint on the nose, where there’s moist compacted fruitcake with marzipan, Brazil nut, glacé cherry, a hint of tobacco, then hard toffee. The palate is soft to start but then an overly firm grip and slightly bitter edges come through. Though water improves it, the oak is slightly too dominant. That said, the nose is superb. £80",124.0,82,55.1,1.0
3408,Dave Broom,"It’s young Macallan. There’s a hint of sulfur (from distillate rather than cask), then wet leather, Brazil nut, muesli, dried pineapple, and raisin; even a little rubber, suggestive of youth. That can’t hide the fact that this is a big, deep, oily dram. Water makes it considerably more coherent, showing a substantial, thick palate with some licorice. Ripe, but you can’t help feeling that 12 is a little young for this slow-maturing distillate.",53.0,82,40.0,1.0

3411,Dave Broom,"Another catch-up from G&M, this time from the ‘Beast of Dufftown.’ Immediate substance and solidity, which is what you want from Mortlach, but there’s also thick-cut marmalade and cumin. Only with water, however, does the classic meatiness emerge—like a lamb tangine with apricot. A cleaner, slightly lighter side to the Flora & Fauna 16 year old, but with heft and a burnt licorice sweetness. A great introduction to a classic distillery.",80.0,82,43.0,1.0

3414,John Hansell,"A relative newcomer to the Scotch whisky industry, having just turned 12. And over the past decade, we’ve had plenty of opportunity to watch this whisky mature, as it was first bottled after a few years as Drumguish, and then under the Speyside name as an 8 year old and 10 year old before this 12 year old expression.

3421,John Hansell,"Distilled in 2008, this is the youngest whiskey in the group. A vast departure from last year’s release — which was delicious — particularly on the palate. This year’s is thinner and less complex, with unintegrated spice, botanical, and vegetal notes dominating. Yes, there’s some honey, vanilla, bright fruit, and a hint of toffee, but it doesn’t help. Easily the weakest whiskey in this year’s Antique Collection, and a bit of a disappointment.",80.0,82,64.6,2.0

3437,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Oh! The glory of new wood. Even dialed back from 6 years old to 5 this version pushes Canadian Club’s entry level mixing whisky into sippin’ territory. The century-old formula is unchanged, but brand new oak emphasizes the rye grain while injecting soft oak caramels and crispy bright barrel notes into the familiar, peppery, overripe dark fruit of one of the world’s longest continuously produced whiskies.

Toffee apple intoxicated with kiln-trapped peat smoke, charcoal ash, anise, honeyed malt, brine, peppered seaweed, kippers, and damp earth. Brisk and warming. Okay, this is a young, “in your face” Islay single malt. Young Islay whiskies show the true character of Islay (which I like), and this is a young one.

The fruity richness of the portwood is subdued, but present, and lays across everything else in the nose. Things become less one-dimensional on the palate, and the sweet broad grassiness of the wheat lightens the portwood influence somewhat, but it comes back in the finish. It’s a decent combo, but a bit of a one-note song. Price is per 375ml.",30.0,82,43.0,
3453,Dave Broom,"Very Singleton of Dufftown: while that means easy drinking and approachable, it also
can suggest a single malt without a spark of wayward genius. This is,
typically, very ordered: nuts and honey with malt and pecan pie underneath. As
it opens there’s dried lemon, oak, dried fig, and (dilute) pencil shavings. The
palate is—typically—sweet and thick, though here with a refreshing sharpness,
like a mix of wine gums and cider. I’d add a rock or two of ice. (Travel Retail exclusive) £38/1 liter",58.0,82,40.0,1.0
3454,Gavin Smith,"Hazelburn CV is the non-age-statement version of Springbank’s unpeated, triple distilled single malt, introduced in 2010 to accompany the existing 8 and 12 year old variants. Initially slightly mashy and herbal on the nose, with acetone and cigarette packets. Citric and more malty with time. Orange, ginger, vanilla, and sherbet zest on the spicy palate. The finish is medium in length and spicy, with a slight suggestion of salt. A fresh, breezy, aperitif dram. £33 (Not available in the U.S.)",52.0,82,46.0,1.0
3456,Lew Bryson,"The second craft rye I’m revisiting. Mosby’s is still 100% organic rye and unaged, but the nose is more fun: some green pear and melon esters in there with the grassy rye spice. It’s nicely smooth on the tongue, delivers exactly what the nose promised, plus a shot of fresh-cracked black pepper…and a much longer finish these days. Greatly improved; a good white whiskey.",38.0,82,40.0,3.0
3458,Dave Broom,"Master of Malt is an online whisky retailer, branching out with its own bottlings. This, from an unnamed distillery, is lightly honeyed with some quince, apricot, and yellow plum, while there’s a mix of vanillin and dry bracken/grass behind. Light, clean, and balanced, the palate is refined and relaxed with Demerara-like sweetness and a finish of honey-coated nuts. I wanted more oomph on the palate, which might have come at 43% or 46%. £100",157.0,82,40.0,1.0
3462,Lew Bryson,"Thin corn sweetness, nice splash of mint and cinnamon. The whiskey's warm, but not hot, and it's exceptionally smooth. There's a slice of rye spice, and oaky vanilla, and the finish is clean and sweet. But it's almost too smooth, and not gutsy enough; if Stagg is bourbon turned up to eleven, this is at about six and a half. Cedar Ridge has a great start here; now show me more.",34.0,82,40.0,2.0
3464,Lew Bryson,"Sharpish nose, hot corn, peppermint, a bit of grape, and underlying cocoa. Sweet mouthful of vanilla and corn, the cocoa's here, and some oakspice. Finish is a bit rough and hot, but not unpleasant. This works better than the sherry-assisted takeoff of their rye whiskey. Could be more rounded, but it's well-constructed and solid.",35.0,82,45.5,2.0
3466,John Hansell,"Easy-going and uncluttered, but also not very complex. Balanced, straightforward notes of caramel, vanilla, creamed corn, subtle fruit, soft mint, and delicate cinnamon. A versatile bourbon: you won’t feel guilty using it in a cocktail, and it will do in a pinch to drink neat or with a splash of water.",27.0,82,42.0,2.0
3467,Lew Bryson,"Mashbill of corn, smoked barley, rye, and wheat, and a ruddy, almost garnet color to it. Smells like barrel drool in a rickhouse; kinda raunchy and sweet, with broad notes of vanilla and hot corn. Quite a mouthful at 100 proof, and after a short initial wave of sweet, the smoke shouts through, squeezing and wringing the other flavors dry, right through the finish. Water makes it paradoxically hotter.",50.0,82,50.0,3.0
3468,Lew Bryson,"Quite dark brown in the glass, and lots of vanilla and fruit — white grapes, pear — in the nose, with a sweet, clean floral character as well; a rich nose. Vibrant with malt and vanilla in the mouth, rather hot without water, and shot through with oakspice, which dominates the finish, though the vanilla struggles through. Water helps the heat in the middle, but not the finish. Texas is pretty darned hot!",85.0,82,51.2,3.0
3469,Lew Bryson,"A restrained nose of fresh-cut oak, grassy rye, and a fleeting trace of solvents. Quite sweet in the mouth, spicy and minty, and the alcohol is fiery: this is young rye. Still, it's much less forward and rudely insistent than I'd expected; not at all the ripsnorter some young ryes are. This could be pleasant, but the finish is a letdown: sweet, mealy, uninspiring.",80.0,82,50.0,3.0
3470,Lew Bryson,"Standard bottling benchmark. Smells sweet, caramel and toffee, with some alcohol heat and a slight medicinal twang. Strong caramel flavor (is that where that rich amber color came from?), not particularly deep or complex, but not hot or flawed either, leading to a gentle sweet finish. Not bad at all for a mixing whisky.",10.0,82,40.0,4.0
3472,Lew Bryson,"Sweet Canadian whisky nose, taffy, some vanilla. Taste is fairly rich, with notes of port and light cocoa, leading to a clean finish with a good grip. Not a tremendously deep whisky, but approachable and free of flaws.",14.0,82,40.0,4.0
3473,Lew Bryson,"Aged in new charred oak, then finished in “white wine-seasoned French oak.” Tight, sawdusty, bitter nose. A lot of wood here, going in different directions. First hit is the American oak (vanilla, rich spice), followed quickly by creamy French oak, then comes a wave of fruity wine wood character. Full in the mouth, and a thick finish. Interesting, but not particularly well integrated; maybe a case of “just because you can, doesn’t mean you should.” Sourced whiskey.",42.0,82,45.0,3.0
3474,Lew Bryson,"There’s a hot, brittle nose of sweet spice, like a cinnamon Red Hot floating in alcohol, with a softer backing of cornmeal underneath. This is a well-behaved bourbon in the mouth; no off-flavors, easy to hold on the tongue, with more corn than spice now, and a lack of wood until the finish, when it wraps in on the corn to dry things up a bit. Simple, sweet, a little spicy, and really easy to drink; a good start.",40.0,82,43.0,3.0
3476,Lew Bryson,"Like the other Taos Lightning Rye, there’s an MGP provenance that’s topped with local aging; it is stated to be a 5 year old whiskey. There’s the signature brittle-dry mint of this mashbill, some hot oak and shortbread. The mouth is quick, spicy, and hot, but not over-balanced in any direction. Good, but not setting off the shock and awe.",60.0,82,45.0,3.0
3477,Lew Bryson,"An estate white whiskey: the corn in this spirit was all grown and harvested on the Myer farm, a Finger Lakes farm dating back to the 1860s. The nose is clean and green, a focused blast of unmodified corn. The spirit is zesty and fresh, sweet and grassy/minty; easy to hold on the tongue until a final heat that fires the finish. If the finish were a bit smoother…still quite good for unaged whiskey.",22.0,82,43.3,3.0
3478,Lew Bryson,"Unaged corn whiskey from Philadelphia. The distinctive white corn spirit smell: crushed corn leaves, wet cornmeal, hint of fruit and split stone. A singular flavor, though: the usual flabby, green sweetness isn’t here. Instead, there’s a dry, solid corn flavor, something that tastes complete, arrived. I could ask for more complexity, but the focused, dry intensity of it has a singular appeal, asking only ice — or a lager chaser — to make a great afternoon.",25.0,82,44.4,3.0
3479,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Highwood Distillers has returned from their devastating 2013 flood with better whisky than ever. A soft, sweet, fruity nose understates the power of an intensely spicy palate chock-full of sour, bitter kumquats. Subtle honey flavors abound, with delicate threads of golden burley tobacco entwined. It’s a simple dram for mixing, but with plenty of interest to satisfy those who would rather sip. Add ginger ale and ice, or drink straight up. (Canada only) C$30",24.0,82,40.0,4.0
3484,Lew Bryson,"Made in Washington State with Washington barley in a copper pot still, and aged “over a year” in new, charred, 10 gallon oak barrels. Good color; nose is frisky and young, with fresh oak and big pear aromas, and a hot feel. Hot and direct in the mouth: grainy, some of that pear, and a somewhat bland but appealing cereal sweetness. Finish is more of the same, with a flick of heat at the end.",40.0,82,40.0,
3485,Davin de Kergommeaux,"12 year old 100% Canadian rye-grain whisky is transported from Canada to Hood River Distillers’ plant in Oregon where, after adding glacier water from Mt. Hood, it is bottled. Tart lime juice, ginger, and seething pepper brighten a rich combination of vanilla, butterscotch, and maple fudge. Crisp charred oak meets wet slate as raisins meld into floral notes with tinges of Canada balsam and fresh-cut pine. This rich, weighty, well-balanced whisky is decidedly fresh and exuberant.",33.0,82,40.0,4.0
3489,Fred Minnick,"At 6 years, 4 months, and 4 days old, there’s a bit of an old-school bourbon nose, with caramel and butterscotch leading. Chocolate, cinnamon, and nutmeg follow. What starts out promising turns to grain, opening up to cornbread, freshly baked rye bread, and vanilla cupcake batter. Once the chewy-to-dry mouthfeel is established, there’s walnut bread, rice pudding, and buttered toast over heat. With water, the grain disappears and malty caramel dominates. This needs water or ice to maximize potential.",60.0,82,64.5,2.0
3490,Lew Bryson,"No age statement, “charcoal filtered.” Hard candy/sweet-spicy nose with some wood edginess, stewed corn, and mineral notes; not particularly well-integrated. The thin body flashes vanilla and light caramel across the tongue as some hot oak fires things up. On the lean side, and like most such bourbons, the finish lingers, and flares at each swallow: oak, cinnamon, and that same mineral note. Not bad, but it needs more. Sourced whiskey.",21.0,82,41.5,2.0
3491,Lew Bryson,"Simple nose of sweet cornbread and oaky caramel; nothing fancy, but nothing wrong. The nose is no liar; same tastes in the
mouth, just a bit hotter on the oak. Good finish with a nice oaky linger. The letdown is the thin body, which adds to the heat and steals from the experience. Seems more like a good shot bourbon or an “…and ginger ale” bourbon, not a sipping bourbon. Sourced whiskey.",21.0,82,43.0,2.0
3492,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Alberta’s Liquor Depot has chosen a tiny Ontario distillery for an exclusive single malt bottling. Still Waters, in Toronto, is Canada’s first craft distillery to bottle single malt whisky. This one is peppery hot and bathed in sweet barley sugar, clover honey, and rich oaky caramels. Brisk, nutty, and oaky, it remains sweet, with green pears. A weighty body, with grassiness, dry grain, and hot white pepper, typifies Still Waters’ emerging house style. (Alberta only.) C$70",70.0,82,46.0,
3493,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This sweet, peppery dram secures Still Waters’ reputation for single malt prodigies: young whiskies mature beyond their years. Cinnamon, enhanced by mild herbal bitterness, rides waves of barley sugar. Sweetness and heat grow stronger as the whisky sits in your mouth. Water brings grassiness to the nose and cooked cream of wheat to the palate. Mid-palate hints of celery add breadth while linseed oil, earthy blue clay, and hints of eucalyptus linger in a long peppery finish. (U.S. only.)",95.0,82,60.3,4.0
3494,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Still Waters distillery’s owners invited customers to select their next single cask release. Noting the soft cereal notes, stewed apples and raisins, and hot spices in an oily body, they recommended this one. A fruity nose with barrel tones and icing sugar blossoms in the glass while the hot, spicy palate shows hints of licorice, cloves, and vanilla. A good dash of water mollifies a drying tendency without dampening the flavor or creaminess. (Distillery only) C$100",92.0,82,63.2,4.0
3495,Lew Bryson,"Aggressive nose of bitter orange, dark chocolate, and pine comes boiling out of the glass. More gentle on the palate: the same notes, but wrapped in sweet malt. A bit hot and crinkly on the tongue, an assertive whisky, but it fades quickly at the end. Good flavor, but a lack of depth; everything Defiant has is right there on top, there’s nothing to discover. The pine is off-putting, too; not sure where that’s coming from.",40.0,82,41.0,3.0
3496,Lew Bryson,"Clean nose, hard grain, some grassy sweetness, a bit perfumey. Interesting on the tongue: grain, sweet orange, and meadow grass; has a pleasantly creamy texture. Gets just a bit solvent-touched at the finish, but overall, an interesting sip…which brings up the question again: what are these ‘white whiskeys’ for? Cocktails, highballs, neat sipping? This one, I think, could pull off all three, the kind of white whiskey that compares to white rum. Sourced whiskey.",25.0,82,46.5,3.0
3497,Lew Bryson,"Made by ex-Dickel distiller John Lunn at the brand's new distillery, a new bottling, new name. “Distilled from grain and sugar.” Smells like clean white dog: warm, ripe melon, alcohol heat, grain. Smoothly drinkable, not hot or astringent. Simple, sweet: melon, cooked grain. Sweeter than vodka, and a bit more flavorful, but otherwise pretty similar. I still don't get the attraction.",29.0,82,44.0,3.0
3498,Gavin Smith,"This single cask (#10328) bottling was distilled in the summer of 2006 and matured in a refill hogshead. The nose is initially slightly mashy, with savory notes, becoming more floral, with caramel. Bold and spicy on the palate, with roasted meat and underlying citrus fruit and herbal notes. Mildly metallic dark chocolate in the medium-length finish.  £42",67.0,82,46.0,1.0
3499,Dave Broom,"Light gold. A little shy initially, but Glenallachie isn’t noted for its effusiveness. It has a clean and slightly nutty aroma, with light honey alongside grilled hazelnut. The palate is fairly crisp and slightly bunched up to start, until this nutty sweetness expands in the center. Ever so slightly oily. Water flattens the aromatics a bit, but allows the flavors to spread gently. All in all, a decent example of an uncommonly seen single malt. £85",130.0,82,51.5,1.0
3500,Gavin Smith,"An 11 year old Fettercairn from Douglas Laing, this is an undemanding but pleasing Highland dram. It comes from a distillery which tends to polarize opinion among drinkers. The nose is light and crisp, slightly floral, with pear juice and a hint of honey. Sweet and spicy on the palate, with hazelnuts and drinking chocolate. Powdery in the finish, with tangerines and a suggestion of Parma violets. £37",56.0,82,45.0,1.0
3501,Dave Broom,"Full gold. A solid middle-weight Macallan with some putty/Play-Doh, and even after this length of time, a certain youthful airiness. This slightly lean aspect gives way to an almost suety richness. When neat, the palate is a little jumbled: caramelized cask-derived notes, cereal, oiled jackets. Water improves things, releasing an aroma akin to Chenin Blanc, then cooked pear and a big hit of sugared almonds on the back palate. £69",101.0,82,51.5,1.0
3502,Dave Broom,"A broad and humid aroma, like walking through hot bracken in the summer. Quite substantial, with lemon, pecan, and, in time, chestnut. It’s this last aroma that carries through most strongly onto the tongue. There’s light grip, and even at 46% some level of heat. Water reveals oak and pencil shavings/cedar, while the grip has now loosened. Out comes a more crisp attack and hints of delicate top notes. The finish is pretty dry. £56",88.0,82,46.0,1.0
3503,Jonny McCormick,"Overripe cantaloupe, green apple, banana custard, and whole almond are the main soloists, though they are accompanied by a linear grain overture running through it. A quartet of golden sultana, mint, ginger, and pepper play the opening movement, then sit back as toffee-dipped banana flavors orchestrate a delicious climax before a diminuendo into minor chords, with sour gooseberry and herbal notes to finish. Water works well, elevating bright notes of lemon sponge on the palate. (238 bottles)",191.0,82,52.1,1.0
3505,Dave Broom,"Gold. Quite sweet and spicy nose. Light cinnamon and that distillery ginger edge. There remains a light cereal aspect to the background, but it is considerably more youthful than the age suggests. The palate is equally sweet and direct, with excellent spicy concentration. Water shows that there is some weight here, reminiscent of honey-nut cornflakes (with cream). The nose now hints at some oxidation, the palate retains peppery freshness. It’s another I’d have kept in cask. £135",206.0,82,50.4,1.0
3508,Lew Bryson,"Sharp nose of fresh, wet grain, hot honey, a little butterscotch, crushed boxwood leaves, and a touch of linseed; an herbal smell. Mouth is roundly sweet, with honey and pie crust notes that meet the oak and pretty it up. There’s mint here, which surprised me; maybe from the wood? This one’s dainty, delicate, and maybe a bit too sweet, but it maintains an edge of oak that keeps it serious. Price is per 375 ml.",35.0,82,42.5,3.0
3509,Lew Bryson,"Malt whiskey with a mashbill similar to a craft-brewed stout—think dark roasted malts—and then aged in new charred oak with an addition of toasted French oak. The nose is sweet young malt touched with chocolate. There’s an additional hit of cocoa at first taste, then heat, oak, vanilla, and more sweet malt, followed by a finish that’s increasingly chocolatey and dry. Young, and could use more complexity and maturing, but full of good flavors. Price is per 375 ml.",28.0,82,40.0,3.0
3510,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Deep golden in color with a pinkish cast, this shows good purity of fruit, with red berry, black cherry, toasty oak, and some oxidative nutty notes layered across a creamy, malty palate. A nice grilled-fruit palate echoes with sweetness and charcoal smoke on the long finish. The sherry contributes a lot of nice character, but without more overall maturity feels a bit like window dressing.",40.0,82,46.0,3.0
3513,Dave Broom,"Massive with a huge sherried attack; seven years is the right time to bottle. There’s light raisin, date, and fig roll/treacle toffee, but it’s a funny one as it develops; while it is superficially impressive, it becomes clear that the oak-driven and distillery-derived parts, aren’t talking to each other. Water brings out light cask-driven sulfur. On the palate, the black fruits and Demerara rum take initial charge along with menthol. It’s tannic already, though. Lacks integration, but what else to do?",135.0,82,67.4,1.0
3515,Fred Minnick,"The new packaging of Old Grand-Dad doesn’t say bottled in bond, but only “bonded.” At first look, the impression is not good. The straw color makes me think it’s young. Then grains burst out of the glass with a hint of mint. Is this repackaged young whiskey? Then, to my surprise, an explosion. Baking spices, freshly baked bread, and cinnamon roll bring this whiskey home. I’d love to taste it after a few more years in the barrel, but it’s mighty tasty as it is now.",25.0,82,50.0,2.0
3516,Lew Bryson,"Despite the common Heaven Hill origin, this is not the same stuff as Dant. The nose is focused, dry, integrated: sweet corn, the inside of an old wooden drawer, and a flip of sweet spice. Lively in the mouth, almost playfully light: corn fritters and filigreed oak. If you mix this, go light; this is not a heavy bonded trooper. One cube, a small splash; then enjoy the delicacy.",13.0,82,50.0,2.0
3517,Lew Bryson,"Unaged. Richly sweet with corn, and a bit of new make funk. Replicated very closely on the tongue: alcohol heat, corn sweetness, wild flowers/stems, and faint notes of overripe fruit, with some drying minerality on the finish. Interesting where it’s not clean; a balance of craft and cunning.",28.0,82,47.5,3.0
3518,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"A coppery, auburn color betrays small barrels, in this case just ten gallons. The distinctive aroma of sassafras recalls rolling in a pile of autumn leaves, then quickly gives way to the apparent spice of a high-rye mashbill. The earthy and spicy qualities meld nicely, developing cedar box and sandalwood, wrapped in the sweetness of maple syrup, while the palate feels slick and buttery before a finish lingering with cinnamon and warm oatmeal cookie.",40.0,82,47.0,3.0
3521,Lew Bryson,"Corn and oak on the nose, with a slice of fruit from sherry cask aging. Nose is strikingly different from the other two Hillrocks reviewed; sweeter, and softer. It’s clearly bourbon at the front, but as the flavors move back in the mouth and into the finish, the sherry takes over and dominates, becoming quite fruity at the close, though with a firm grip of charred oak. The sherry’s too much for a bourbon, especially at this price. Partially sourced whiskey.",80.0,82,46.3,
3522,Lew Bryson,"Part of this Pittsburgh distillery’s series of “Whims” one-offs. Truly interesting nose: a combination of new-barrel bourbon reek and Irish raw barley grassiness, yielding mint, vanilla, juicy wet grain, and faint cinnamon. Hot entry of vanilla and small-barrel oak, which suddenly collapses to a dry cocoa sweetness spiked with hot pepper, like Mexican chocolate. This typifies a lot of craft efforts: not a great whiskey now, but one with terrifically interesting potential. I hope Wigle pursues this Whim. Price is per 375 ml.",34.0,82,46.0,3.0
3523,Lew Bryson,"I reviewed a couple of these one-off Wigle Whims earlier. This one’s quite roasty indeed, almost coffee-like, made with roasted barley and wheat, and caramel and chocolate malts. It smells of burnt grain with sweet toffee underneath. Lots of chocolate and cocoa struggle with ash and burnt grain, leading to a hot finish where they end up, finally, in agreement, a smoky mocha mouthful, espresso whiskey. Invigorating. Price is per 375 ml.",34.0,82,46.0,3.0
3524,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Balance makes this simple session whisky a well-loved hot Sunday sipper, while searing pepper and vanilla-rich butterscotch lend it well to mixing. Order rye and ginger in a bar in Canada and you may well find yourself savoring Special Old. Toffee with hints of ginger on the nose broaden into blazing chilies with notes of cloves and cinnamon. Soft barrel notes, damp earth, and sweet toffee segue neatly into a very long, hot, bitter, cleansing finale. (Canada only)",25.0,82,40.0,4.0
3527,Lew Bryson,"Onyx (East Hartford, Conn.) ages their 'moonshine' in new charred oak barrels to make this expression.  Nose is fresh-sawn oak and sugar cookies, with a bit of cinnamon spice. Tons of fresh oak in the mouth (I'd guess this is small-barrel whiskey) with a spicy sweetness, a hallmark of young craft whiskey, as is the quick finish. Still, no real flaws, and pleasant enough.",35.0,82,41.5,
3530,Lew Bryson,"MGP-sourced bourbon is finished in Madeira barriques, and shows a nicely reddish color. Nose is corn and wine gums; not hot, not sweet. Flash-hot in the mouth, light body and some candy and minerality with the corn; a prickly heat and acidity at the end, but overall, more pleasant than that sounds.",69.0,82,45.5,3.0
3531,Dave Broom,"Once again, some assertive distillery character to the fore which, in BenRiach’s case, means plenty of ripe sweet fruits, cooked apples, a jag of citrus, and a background malty note. There’s a pleasant, slightly oxidative, wine-like note with water. The sweetness dominates the palate, with the nuttiness moving to hot breakfast cereal and, in typical BenRiach fashion, a sweet spiced finish. Lovely, but not overly different from official bottlings.",145.0,82,46.5,1.0
3532,Lew Bryson,"A blend of three bourbons, between 6 and 12 years old; two rye and one wheat. Nothing is revealed on the source, which is a fair part of the “blood oath,” apparently. A restrained nose of corncakes, biscuits, a bit of cinnamon and maple: breakfasty. Flavors of corn, spicy oak, and some grassy mint fight to be heard over roaring heat that flames on into the finish. Frankly too simple for the asking price. Sourced whiskey.",90.0,82,49.3,
3535,Lew Bryson,"MGP bourbon aged to 4 years. Sweet and brittle nose, hot and a bit spicy, but thin. More spice and body on the tongue than the Old Hickory Blended, and a more balanced finish, but still a relatively light whiskey. Beautiful bottle, classic label; I wish there was more whiskey here. Sourced whiskey.",40.0,82,43.0,2.0
3537,Lew Bryson,"Sourced bourbon at 3 to 10 years old was dumped and finished in Napa Valley wine barrels. The nose is mostly bourbon—corn, warm meadow, hard candy—with a floater of wine wood; I'm guessing white wine. The flavor is quite woody, but not old wood; fresher, and a bit astringent, overshadowing the whiskey. Not sure the finish does it a favor. Sourced whiskey.",40.0,82,43.4,2.0
3538,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The freshly opened bottle smells promising, with spirit, toffee, suggestions of cloves, a blast of steely rye, and grapefruit juice on the nose. On the palate it is sweet, somewhat hot, slightly perfumed, and overall, quite simple. A lovely glow in the back of the mouth and on the tongue doesn’t last, but is replaced by hints of caramel and citrus fruit. Good, solid session whisky.",15.0,82,40.0,4.0
3539,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The nose shows great promise, with real maple syrup, gummy bears, hints of peppermint and cinnamon, and clean lumber. Tangerine juice, dark fruits, white pepper, and ginger seem somehow less than the nose predicted. It feels good, with its creamy smooth palate and glowing gingery heat. Finishes with mild grapefruit pith and searing pepper that goes on forever.",21.0,82,40.0,4.0
3540,Fred Minnick,"Somewhat forgotten, this table bourbon is ripe with fired-corn salsa, citrus zest, and a hint of butterscotch. It could use another year or two in the barrel, but the grains, caramel, and fruit (with a hint of spice) are delicious on their own. Want a house bourbon for cocktails? This is a fine pick.",15.0,82,50.0,2.0
3541,Lew Bryson,"Label says “Dunkel,” release says “Dunkelweizen,” two very different beers. Mostly strong sawn oak on the nose, with some clove (so maybe Dunkelweizen is closer). Springy, spicy, and a bit oily on the tongue; German gingerbread on the finish. (375 ml.)",35.0,82,45.0,3.0
3543,Fred Minnick,"You can actually smell the cooper toasting oak here, so the name carries real meaning. Then cotton candy, fresh-baked rye, vanilla, apple, and caramel come to life. A slight hint of grain becomes more expressive on the tongue, offering bread-like flavors with hints of brown sugar and honey. Short finish with a hint of grain. If you like light-bodied bourbons, this is right up your alley.",29.0,82,41.1,2.0
3544,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Made with 100% rye aged up to 5 years, this starts off surprisingly fruit-forward, with poached pear and zesty, clove-pierced citrus, though the wood is beginning to dominate. The palate fires up the rye spice, underscored by cocoa, turning hot with some adhesive notes and finishing with fresh cereal grain and bitter oak tannins. A wood lover’s whiskey.",40.0,82,46.5,
3545,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Pretty fruit gets swept up in distinct anise and fennel-bulb aromas, with hints of mint and quinine, backed by vanilla. Very soft, creamy, and rounded on the palate, the peachy stone fruit comes nicely balanced with oak, sweet vanilla, and glimmers of nutmeg and clove spices before the cocoa powder finish. Well-constructed, smooth, and easy-drinking with a pleasant persistence of fruit.",40.0,82,42.0,3.0
3549,John Hansell,"This is the new super-peated (131 ppm phenol barley) Bruichladdich. “Super-peated” seems almost like an understatement. Ultra-peated, perhaps? Intense smoke on the nose and palate, with notes of freshly tarred road, cigar smoke and ash, licorice root, bacon fat, kalamata olive, and smoked seaweed. Struggling to emerge are youthful orchard fruit, honeyed malt, brine, and soft vanilla. Long, smoky finish -- like licking the walls of a peat-infused kiln. A very invigorating whisky. It’s a few years younger than the other ultra-peated whisky, Ardbeg Supernova. I think if they were both the same age, I would like them equally (and score them equally -- I gave Supernova an 89). But the Octomore does taste a little green, which was not noticeable in the Supernova. I think Octomore will be very good in another five years, and amazing in another ten.

3550,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"The oak is nicely subdued and integrated here, allowing buttered fruits to show through—baked spiced apple and poached pear—laced with spearmint and bay leaf. The creamy palate is nicely balanced with baking spices of cinnamon and clove and hints of pepper, giving way to a pleasantly drying, chalky finish. Price is per 375 ml.",40.0,82,50.0,3.0
3551,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Very oaky, with a nose of fresh sawdust, but beneath lurk deep maple sweetness, pralines, and cherry cough drop. The palate is chewy, sweet, and nutty, with pleasing caramel and butterscotch, but is hurt by some peculiar varnish and furniture polish notes. Finishes with cherry, leather, and more oak.",65.0,82,50.0,3.0
3552,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"The rye spice on the nose is big, broad, and aromatic, with allspice and clove in the mix, but there are some distillation issues, with a slight rubber-tire note of feints. Rich and viscous on the palate, it’s slightly hot, but shows really lovely spice and toasted nuts, turning oak-dominated on the finish.",35.0,82,42.0,3.0
3553,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Sweet and simple candied nose. Palate is thin, bright, and lemony, like a fluffy mouthful of sweet marshmallows, with hints of banana, circus peanuts candy, and gingery spice. Not especially complex, but pleasant enough.",38.0,82,45.0,3.0
3554,Susannah Skiver Barton,"The caramel on the nose is a bit strange and chemical, but the palate offers promise with its pleasing spice, sweetness, orange peel, chocolate, and silky mouthfeel. There are lovely flavors, but the oak feels layered on rather than integrated.

This whisky has been matured using alternative aging technology.
Actual Time in Barrel: minimum 12 months;
Processing: Distilled in Indiana and aged in new charred oak barrels, then put through a finishing process using sherry-seasoned Spanish oak pieces.",35.0,82,45.0,2.0

3556,John Hansell,"The newest offering from Crown Royal. Drier and more spice, with less of the creaminess of its siblings. I enjoy the subtle, dry complexity on the nose and the promise on the first part of the palate. But the whisky quickly turns quite dry on the latter part, with the oak playing the dominant role. XR contains older whiskies (including some from the old Waterloo distillery), so this is a rare whisky indeed, but it is difficult to improve on the profound effort of Crown Royal Special Reserve.",150.0,81,40.0,4.0
3557,John Hansell,"Light in body and on the nose, but clean and elegant. Notes of delicate fruit, vanilla, and honey, with a touch of caramel and coconut cream. Soft, clean finish. A pleasant, conservative whisky.",22.0,81,,4.0
3558,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Whisky maker John Hall says value whiskies save used barrels from being wasted. Study the label and you’ll find this lush mixer hails from Hall’s Forty Creek distillery. Sweet voluptuous butterscotch and corn syrup slather peppery heat and the mildest tannins. The pepper turns ticklish on the roof of your mouth until charred wood, burned toffee, and vanilla custard flow over it. Simple but very sippable, it’s a bit luxurious for a mixing whisky.

3561,John Hansell,"Background on the Master’s Collection: this is the fourth of the 100% pot still whiskeys from Woodford Reserve in their Master’s Collection series (the previous being two different Four Grain releases and a Sonoma-Cutrer wine finish expression). All four have a common pot still character to them, and their flavors really expand most bourbon drinkers’ concept of bourbon. The second batch of Four Grain is still my clear favorite of the releases so far. It’s balanced and complex.
1838 Sweet Mash review: Burnt orange/amber color. Sweet, fruity, and spicy on the nose and palate. Notes of orchard fruit (peach, apple), golden raisin, bramble, and spice (cinnamon, evergreen, nutmeg, and clove) on a bed of sweetness (maple syrup and honey). It’s thick and viscous in texture and quite sweet on the front end of the palate, but dried spices and oak emerge mid-palate and rescue it. Long, spicy, resinous finish. I would rather the whisky didn’t go from predominantly sweet to mostly dry and gritty. I wish these two components were better integrated. If they were, I would have rated this whiskey higher.",90.0,81,43.2,2.0
3562,John Hansell,"Aged in American oak, and then finished in maple, sherry, and portwood. The nose is intriguing and entertaining, but the palate loses me. At the beginning, it’s sweet to the point of bordering on cloying, and then there’s an emergence of flavors (wood spice, stewed fruit, caramel, etc.) that turns very busy and lacks integration. The flavors just don’t play well with each other. To me, the whiskey is trying too hard to impress and achieves the opposite.",100.0,81,47.2,2.0
3563,John Hansell,"Finished in pinot noir barrels. A very fruit-forward whiskey. I love bourbon, and I love pinot noir, but the wine influence is very intense and, to me, the flavors don’t integrate well. Cherries, red raspberry, and red currant dominate, along with a coating of caramel. Cinnamon and clove struggle to emerge from underneath it all. Sweet, fruity finish. Bonus points for uniqueness, but a bit overdone with the wine influence.",100.0,81,45.2,
3564,John Hansell,"Aged in French oak chardonnay barrels for eight years after ten years in new oak. The oak influence is significantly greater in this bottling. Briefly sweet up front, with caramel, vanilla, candied fruit, and golden raisin. Then the oak resin, leather, and tobacco leaves take over, along with subtle black licorice stick. The dry oak finish lingers.",50.0,81,45.0,2.0
3565,John Hansell,"Much more oak influence than its younger sibling. That lovely sweetness of the 19 year old Experimental Collection Giant French Oak Barrel bottling is there at the beginning, but it’s quickly overtaken by oak spice, leather, and tannin notes. This one was left in the barrel a bit longer than I would prefer. If you like a wood-driven whiskey, then consider trying it. But if it’s balance you desire, look elsewhere.  Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,81,45.0,2.0
3566,John Hansell,"Light in body, with soft fruit, graham cracker, and delicate honey. Oak tannin, leather, and prickly spice kick in mid-palate, but there’s not enough body and sweet notes to balance it.  Warm, spicy finish. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,81,45.0,2.0
3567,John Hansell,"Antique amber in color. Deep, mature aromas of toffee, wood spices, mint and leather. Medium in body.

3568,John Hansell,"Darker, more lush, and with less of the crisp, lively spice notes when compared to last year’s vintage. (Keep in mind that single cask bottlings vary from cask to cask.) The predominant component of the new vintage is its layers of sweetness (toffee, molasses, vanilla fudge, and candy corn), with underlying nougat and glazed fruit. An enjoyable, soothing bourbon, but I would like to see more spice and fruit to go with the sweet notes. This whiskey will work nicely after dinner (perhaps with a cigar?)",25.0,81,43.3,2.0
3569,John Hansell,"Style: Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey Color: Amber Aroma: Clean, uncomplicated. Notes of caramel, teaberry, delicate candied fruit, and vanilla.

Clean, pleasant finish.",28.0,81,44.0,2.0
3570,John Hansell,"Youthful in nature, and fairly straight-forward. Fresh, minty spice notes accompany some candied citrus fruit and some light toffee. What’s there is pleasing enough. I just wish there was more there (in both flavor and depth).",34.0,81,42.4,2.0
3571,John Hansell,"Style: American whiskey Color: Amber with streaks of gold. Aroma: Layers of sweetness: concentrated vanilla, marshmallow, taffy, white chocolate and caramel.

Sweet and spicy finish.",30.0,81,41.7,2.0
3572,Fred Minnick,"Brown-Forman has made Old Forester since 1870. It sure is easy on the eyes: beautiful tawny hues against the light of sunset. Think Southern bakery.

These delicious flavors don’t last long, making me wonder how it would fare with just a couple more years in the barrel.",26.0,81,50.0,2.0
3573,John Hansell,"A fruity-sweet whisky (but still quite light and lively), with notes of orange marmalade, lemon meringue pie, and apricot. There’s also an underlying vanilla maltiness that is balanced nicely by oak spice on the finish. A respectable effort for a 10 year old and versatile enough to drink any time of the day (but I would prefer it before dinner).",45.0,81,46.0,
3574,John Hansell,"Light, clean, and delicate on the palate, with creamy vanilla, marshmallow, soft fruit (lemon, lime), and a touch of honey throughout. Nicely balanced and uncomplicated. A whisky to appeal to both the malt and blend drinker.",33.0,81,43.0,1.0
3575,John Hansell,"Surprisingly thick and oily in texture for a Lowlander. There’s plenty of marshmallow, vanilla cream, and ripe barley, with interspersed cut grass, lemon, and mustard seed. Drying oak spice notes on the finish. Not as polished or refined as the distillery bottling of the same age, but it still has many redeeming qualities.",145.0,81,52.4,1.0
3576,John Hansell,"Gordon & MacPhail purchased the Benromach distillery from United Distillers and reopened the distillery in 1998. They installed new stills and are using malt with a recognizable level of peating. This is first official bottling from the whisky that they themselves have made. The whisky is still youthful, but for a whisky of such youth it shows great balance, individuality, and promise. Notes of vanilla cream, honey, and fruit (pineapple, pear) are peppered with nuances of smoke, herbs, and pine. Youthful, vibrant finish. I eagerly look forward to tasting this whisky with a half dozen more years of aging.",35.0,81,40.0,1.0
3577,John Hansell,"Nicely balanced, and easy to drink. Pit fruits (peaches, apricots) and lemon are the dominant notes, with underlying vanilla cream, butterscotch, and a hint of honey. Gently dry, delicately spicy finish. The most rounded of the four.",80.0,81,40.0,1.0
3578,John Hansell,"Full gold color. Layers of citrus fruit on the nose (especially Seville orange, lemon, grapefruit), with just a faint hint of peat smoke and floral, herbal notes. Light to medium in body. It tastes similar in many ways to its aroma-there’s plenty of citrus fruit. The fruit comes first, followed by the classic ""older Bowmore"" oaky dryness. An echo of flavors repeats this sequence-first the citrus fruit, then the dry oak flavors. Some peat smoke teases in the background, but is mostly restrained. Fry, oaky, faintly peaty finish.
   Style: Islay single malt Scotch whisky. Price: approx. $160. Available at select retailers. 
   This whisky is classic older Bowmore (30+ years), with its exotic citrus fruit, distinctive oaky dryness, and faintest hint of peat smoke.",160.0,81,45.3,1.0
3579,Dave Broom,"Bowmore in unusually oily guise here, with linseed oil, hot seashells, background water mint, completely integrated smoke, and a cooling note that brings to mind a lido (without any chlorine, I hasten to add). The palate has a limey lift which flows into a quite thick, creamy/oaty mid-palate, with the smoke bedding itself on the tongue. Smoky and mineralic on the finish. Water makes it even more gentle. A light expression for the early morning. £98",153.0,81,48.4,1.0
3580,John Hansell,"Its color suggests sherry cask influence, and its aroma confirms. The initial impact on the palate is lush fruit, followed by a clean honeyed malt foundation. Toffee and nuts emerge, with that satisfying Bruichladdich freshness and brine kicking in on the finish, providing some balance for the somewhat waxy, sherried sweetness.

3581,Dave Broom,"Another Travel Retail exclusive, and while you might expect something delicate given the age statement, what is delivered is a thick, buttery/creamy opening that, for a second, teeters on the brink of sourness then pulls back to be more like ricotta cheese. It then settles into vanilla, floral notes, white chocolate, and sweet barley. The palate is thick once again, with lemon cheesecake giving a needed clean acidity. Quite a bulky youngster that’s best with water. (Travel Retail exclusive) £45",65.0,81,50.0,1.0
3582,John Hansell,"This Caol Ila was released the same time as the 12 year old, reviewed above. Older isn't always better, especially with Islay whiskies. I felt that way when comparing Ardbeg 17 to Ardbeg 10 year old, and I feel the same with these two Caol Ila whiskies. This 18 year old has the same flavor profile as the 12 year old. It's a well-rounded dram too, but it has lost the vibrancy and dynamic intensity of the 12 year old. If you want to experience Caol Ila in its entire youthful splendor-and save a few bucks while you're at it-then buy the 12 year old.",65.0,81,43.0,1.0
3583,John Hansell,"Mature and gentle, when compared to the 1990 expression above. If the flavors of the 1990 Caol Ila reviewed above are nakedly exposed, then this Caol Ila is wearing a winter coat. The same flavor notes are there, but they’re less noticeable. Pleasingly salty, gently drying finish.",135.0,81,43.0,1.0
3584,Dave Broom,"An established regular member of Diageo’s annual set of Special Releases, this expression celebrates the lesser-known side of Islay’s largest distillery; its production of a non-smoked expression. It was this unpeated style that saved Caol Ila during the great decimation of distilleries in the early 1980s. This example is intense and needs LOTS of water for its fragrance of cut grass, sherbet, and coconut water to emerge. The palate shows boiled sweets and has a pleasingly clinging quality. £53",84.0,81,64.0,1.0
3585,Dave Broom,"Initially what we have are classic Caol Ila notes: cod liver oil, soft pear-like fruits, and a glimpse of lobster cooked in sea water. It’s not so much smoky as ozonic and, though it seems a little exposed with water, there’s a squeeze of lemon (for the lobster, maybe). On the tongue there’s a light ashy note before the mouth is slowly filled. Any smoke is in check and understated. This is about citric freshness and salt. £70",109.0,81,46.0,1.0
3586,John Hansell,"Thick in texture and palate-coating. Ripe peaches and bananas, orange chocolate, English toffee, and a hint of damp oak on the nose.

3587,Dave Broom,"Light straw. Initially this is quite hot and a little dumb, with whiffs of Indian spice — think turmeric and curry leaf — along with mint sauce (but no lamb) and a tickle of peat. The palate is quite intense and hot, with powdered almond, a grassy edge, and concentrated sweetness that starts in the center and builds toward the back palate. Subtle, but can’t help wishing there was just a little more say from the cask. £59",93.0,81,,1.0
3588,Gavin Smith,"Deanston distillery has released its first organic single malt, aged for 15 years in new oak barrels. It is non-chill filtered.  Stem ginger, white pepper, cloves, and vanilla on the nose. The palate is rich with intensely sweet early fruit notes, honey, more ginger, and now black pepper.

3589,John Hansell,"From a sherry hogshead, which is confirmed by its deep amber/crimson color. A very clean whisky for 31 years in oak, and its complexity is subtle. It’s sort of the antithesis of the Blackadder Longmorn also reviewed here. Both are heavily sherried. The Longmorn shows its age proudly, and is bold, complex, and a bit rustic. This one is clean, more conservative, and nicely balanced. You’ll find notes of honey-laced fruit, caramel, and toffee, with an infusion of nutty, ginger-spiced notes, leading to a polished oak finish.

3591,John Hansell,"The first official distillery release to the U.S. since the distillery was purchased by Angus Dundee. This is a thick, mouth-coating whisky.

3592,Dave Broom,"More of a reddish hue, but as equally robust as the 1961 (see below). Some baked characters alongside dried cherry and barberry, which shift toward balsamic-like concentration.

3593,Dave Broom,"Bottled for this auspicious occasion, this is a Glenfiddich that confounds people’s expectations by being smoky, not from casks (à la Caoran) but the distillate. Fresh, with a nose that brings to mind eating apples and hazelnuts around a late summer bonfire; the smoke seems in charge. On the palate, the reverse happens, with the fruits being thrust forward and the smoke only emerging on the finish. It’s vibrant and needs water, and is a lot of fun. Happy Birthday!

3594,Dave Broom,"Like Dalwhinnie, Glenkinchie starts life as a (deliberately) sulfury new make, but this character falls away in time to reveal delicacy. As a 10 year old, that sulfur could still be hanging around — one reason for the switch to a 12 year age statement. The improvement is noticeable. Here are gently lifted floral notes, hints of dry grass, and crisp pear. The feel is gentle and slow in the center, while vanilla creeps into the finish. Not complex, but very pleasant.",60.0,81,43.0,1.0
3595,Dave Broom,"A limited edition—there are only 630 bottles of this—for those who are “Glenlivet Guardians.” A sherry refill, it’s a gentle expression that has typical Glenlivet floral elements that are more lifted than usual: elderflower cordial, jasmine, and night-scented stocks.

3596,John Hansell,"Very fragrant and floral, with bright notes of citrus (lemons, orange) and fresh grass. Similar on the palate, with additional notes of soft honeyed malt and vanilla. Clean, fresh, appetizing finish. A nice aperitif or, better yet, a liquid sorbet between courses.",63.0,81,,1.0

3599,John Hansell,"Medium-bodied but viscous in texture. Clearly aged in a bourbon cask-there's plenty of honeyed malt and vanilla throughout. Hints of bourbon even peek through occasionally, along with some subtle peat. Soft melon mid-palate yields to dried spice, sea salt, bitter chocolate and herbal notes on the finish.

3600,Gavin Smith,"This is the oldest expression of Inchmurrin to be released by Loch Lomond, who make it in their highly versatile distillery at
Alexandria. Brittle toffee and cod liver oil on the nose, with vanilla and a whiff of Jaffa oranges. Smooth and full on the palate, more substantial and sophisticated than the younger Inchmurrin variants. The fruits are now more citric.

3604,Dave Broom,"At first I wondered what was going on here. This Lagavulin has more of the austerity typical of Port Ellen. There’s a tense minerality on the nose giving the impression of salty rock-pools and samphire. Water makes it sweeter and oyster-like. There’s big delivery on the tongue, with masses of distillery character, but that tension remains to the saline finish.

3607,John Hansell,"Succulent, sappy, with plenty of oak. This whisky is quite fruity, with tangerine, lemon, and strawberries. It is balanced by fat barley, almonds and damp oak. It is not as polished and rounded as the Gordon & Macphail Longmorn reviewed above. Indeed, the fruity, damp oak notes can be quite dominant in this whisky. However, the whisky evolves constantly on the palate and there are some minty, spicy underlying notes which add intrigue. Definitely save this one for after dinner.",170.0,81,53.5,1.0
3608,John Hansell,"Appetizingly briny and spicy, as would be expected from a Pulteney-especially on the nose.

3609,John Hansell,"Strathisla whisky produced from peaty water, to create a different variant of Strathisla. The two dominant characteristics here are ripe fruit (berries, raisin, pineapple, citrus) and wood spices (cinnamon, clove, mint). The sherry cask and 33 years on oak have left their impact. The fruit and honeyed/toffee almond sweetness is to the fore with the dry spices kicking in later.

This one has a vibrant, edgy opening, almost like a burning lawnmower box, mixed with needed oiliness (gun oil), white tea, and, in time, the rather pleasant note of a cold fish supper. The palate is broad, and though light, the oils allow it to cling to the tongue as the salt, lime, and smoke all begin to build. A little hard, but pleasantly bracing.£44",67.0,81,45.8,1.0
3618,Dave Broom,"It often takes time for a new distillery to find its feet, but Kilchoman’s spirit was top quality from the first day. Its limited-edition releases act as markers on a work in progress, but are precociously advanced for their tender years.

A star is born.",75.0,81,46.0,1.0
3619,Dave Broom,"Diageo’s smallest distillery and another that has worm tubs. The character here is grassy: think hay and straw rather than lawn clippings.

3620,Dave Broom,"A malt that was overlooked by one owner (Glenmorangie) and is now, under the auspices of a new one (La Martiniquaise), beginning to ease itself back into the single malt world. Its problem has been the price: too low (see Speyburn). The standard 12 year old bottling gives a perfect idea of its potential.

3621,Dave Broom,"Thanks to the suicidal pricing policy of its previous owner, Glen Moray has been considered nothing more than a bargain basement malt, but at its best it is a very sweet, lightly malty dram.

3631,Gavin Smith,"Launched in southeast Asia in 2006, 12 year old Glen Ord boasts a nose that is sweet and gingery, with toffee, a hint of tangerine, along with vanilla, sherry, and oriental spices. The palate mirrors the nose with more spice, then chocolate, and milky coffee. Finally, quite drying. RM247",61.0,81,40.0,1.0
3632,Dave Broom,"Glendullan has an unfortunate moniker. Any whisky with ‘dull’ in the middle of its name will always struggle in English-speaking markets. It’s a shame, because it’s always delivered a gentle, sweet, lightly fruity/estery style, making it an ideal lunchtime dram. This ticks all those boxes. Green apples are there, as is cinnamon, alongside a racy acidity before water brings out more scented aromas. The finish is short, but it does its job as an easy-drinking, everyday malt.

3636,Gavin Smith,"The first spirit distilled at Abhainn Dearg is now 3 years old and legally Scotch single malt whisky. The distillery has celebrated with a single cask, non-colored, non-chill filtered release of 2,011 500 ml bottles. Apricots, crystallized ginger, candied peel, and papier-mâché on the nose. The palate features fresh fruit, spicy oak, honeycomb, and finally, toffee. Quite short in the finish, with more toffee, and a nutty note. £150",239.0,81,46.0,1.0
3644,Lew Bryson,"Wow, that's a small barrel whiskey! Only 2 years old, and more like 12 years dark, with a nose stuffed full of oak char, steamy mint, and hot vanilla. You know it's wheat in the mouth; despite the aggressive nose and the heat you do get, this is still pretty friendly stuff for 50%: sweet dough, mint, and more oak. But the finish roars in real hot and a bit astringent, ruining the moment, and water doesn't help.",80.0,81,50.0,3.0
3645,Lew Bryson,"A hot wash of vanilla and sweet cloves and cinnamon, with shouty alcohol heat and a log of oak; whatever else this is, ‘subtle’ is not on the menu. Wow, is that hot in the mouth! Still, it’s flavorful with it; cinnamon candy and corn on the cob gush onto the palate. There are some cobby notes though, and a bit of mustiness. The finish is—surprise!—hot, and fades reluctantly. Doc Bryson prescribes more time in a large barrel.",80.0,81,50.0,3.0
3646,Lew Bryson,"Aged 6 to 7 months in quarter barrels. Sharpish, oaky nose with a sweet grain/golden syrup backing. Spirity in the mouth, with a big slap of young oak up front that quickly subsides, yielding sweet corn muffin, white pepper, and dry cocoa that linger into the finish. Hot, but worth the burn. Some nice components here; age and a bigger barrel could do a better job on integration.",39.0,81,45.0,3.0
3649,Lew Bryson,"A nose like light caramel corn, with a hint of biscuit dryness and a smidgen of cinnamon sugar. Light in the mouth, sweet and a bit spicy, with some cinnamon heat toward the end. There is a bit of a roar right in the middle, where the grainy sweetness catches fire briefly, but mostly this is fairly meek stuff. Made for mixing, no real flaws.",14.0,81,40.0,4.0
3650,Lew Bryson,"A blend of aged (sourced) bourbon and Great Lakes’ own (young) malt whiskey. Quite sweet on the nose; a rich, herbal sweetness with a strong, youthful quality to it. Interestingly medicinal on the tongue as the herbal character swells. A full mouthfeel, with clear references to new make about it: a bit oily, grassy, and bright. The finish is the best part: minty and a bit drying, a pleasant farewell. Interesting concept.",43.0,81,43.0,3.0
3651,Lew Bryson,"Quite mild on the nose for 99 proof: dry oak, light honey, crisp corn. It all fires up in the mouth, a thick wash of hot oak and corn—attic whiskey—white pepper, and a tongue-crinkling woodiness leading to a drying finish that leaves you thirsty and swallowing as it fades. This may only be 6 years old (according to the label) but they were hot years. Better with a bit of water. (sourced whiskey)",34.0,81,49.5,3.0
3656,John Hansell,"Gold color. Youthful, exotic fruit and spice aromas-unlike any whisky I’ve sampled. Light to medium-bodied. Its flavors are like its aromas-you just wouldn’t expect this many types of exotic fruit and spice notes dominating its flavor profile (could it be too much of a good thing?). A honeyed malty sweetness serves as a backdrop. Again, like its aroma, it is youthful in flavor.
Style: Single malt American whiskey. Price: mid $40s. Limited availability.
There are two ways to look at this single malt. As a whiskey, it shows great potential but still needs more time to realize this potential. But in many respects it tastes more like some exotic liqueur. From this perspective, it seems more comfortable with its youth. Personally, I would like to see it with a few more years in the wood. Regardless, it's certainly worth a try. But don't buy an entire bottle until you do.",45.0,81,,2.0
3657,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Creamy butterscotch soothes the blazing hot spices of this archetypal Canadian mixing whisky. Fresh kiwi fruit and lime fragrances add dimension to a sweet, glowing middle, then fade on a long toffeeish finish that finally slips into slight hints of bitter grapefruit pith. A sweet, simple, and fruity session whisky that you could sip neat all evening, or over ice at a sunny poolside. A mixer, yes, and a sipper too. (Canada only) C$26",21.0,81,40.0,4.0
3659,Lew Bryson,"Sweet and a bit funky; maybe a wisp of smoke, maybe some green cornstalk, and some mint/vanilla. Rippling and vibrant in the mouth, hot and bold, and not candy-sweet at all, more like fuel-injected cornbread with a splash of burning mint eau de vie across the top. Or maybe that’s just the AC/DC talking; maybe I should review to Mozart. Not bad, but I think I like the simpler unaged version.",35.0,81,48.5,3.0
3660,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Typical rye spices bathe in rich, smooth caramels and burnt sugar, with a gingery cayenne burn. Real black pepper engulfs cloves and cinnamon in a fiery and vibrant display, while vague tones of milk chocolate gently cool things down. Then an oiliness and mouth-filling richness sweep over a tinge of bitter herbal elixir and, yes, sawdust. This classic high-rye whisky from Alberta Distillers brings suggestions of dark fruit to an underlying nuttiness.",11.0,81,40.0,4.0
3664,Lew Bryson,"Oak, and some candy-like sweetness, and alcohol heat…and not much else. A shy nose for a bourbon. Very hot in the mouth,
somewhat two-dimensional corn and oak, just put together without anything else around them. A pretty simple whiskey, with a slightly cloying finish. Nothing really flawed, just nothing really standing out, either. Sourced whiskey.",25.0,81,45.0,2.0
3665,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Fresh and distinctly grain driven, like slurping warm breakfast cereal, but that malt purity also comes at the expense of complexity and development, with lots of grassy meadow, cut hay notes, that lead to a palate of husky grain and honeyed malt, before a finish sweet, young grass notes.",60.0,81,46.5,3.0
3666,Lew Bryson,"All local Colorado malt, with a little peat-smoked malt. Unaged. No smoke on the nose; fresh, a bit feinty, wet and juicy melon, a hint of cardamom. Smoke is there as it hits the tongue, immediate but gentle. Spirit tastes much cleaner than it smells. Hot on the tongue, prickly. More melon and spice on the finish, a bit creamy. Not a bad white, but quite pricey. Price is per 375 ml.",25.0,81,45.0,3.0
3667,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Despite the orange-amber color, green, stalky corn husk and bramble notes dominate this youngster, with secondary flavors of fruitwood smoke and warm cereal.

3668,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Bonded Stock was a Gooderham and Worts brand until Harry Hatch moved production to Windsor during Prohibition. Dry grain with hints of bicycle tires on the nose become barley sugar and fiery pepper on the palate.

Old-time hard-rye mixing whisky, but go ahead, sneak a wee sip.",10.0,81,40.0,4.0
3669,Davin de Kergommeaux,"For years, about half a dozen large oak barrels of malt spirit sat ignored against the wall of the shop at Okanagan distillery in Vernon, BC. Fruit spirit is their main product. Finally, those barrels have been disgorged and blended into a fruit-forward single malt that tilts and dips like a butterfly in flight. Ripe cherries and dried apricots flit through Kraft caramels and green apple Twizzlers into a long, glowing sunset of hot spices and floral breezes. C$70",63.0,81,40.0,4.0
3670,Dave Broom,"Pale straw. An upfront and quite aromatic nose with hints of a florist’s shop—stems and blooms—with an underpinning of malt. A little gawky perhaps, which water accentuates. The palate, when neat, is clean and mixes those flowers and some stewed apple. There’s a little green chili heat (even when diluted). A punchy little number. £36",53.0,81,46.0,1.0
3672,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Nosing this whisky, you'd never guess just how fruity it is, with barnyard hay, dry malt, honey, and light smoke. On the palate, however, the fruit is unmistakable with giant mango and apple. The mid-palate takes a sharp left turn into smoke and salt, but the mango just won't let go. A very dry, smoky finish is too dry, making the case against release at this ABV. An oddball whisky that will probably only appeal to a very narrow audience. (U.S. only)",155.0,81,54.2,1.0
3673,Dave Broom,"Very fresh and quite light in color, suggestive of only light cask conversation. BenRiach’s fruits are there with hints of apricot, even some gooseberry. Very light malty background, and then a whiff of witch hazel. In time, it sweetens into banana and pineapple. The palate is clean, though pretty hot, with that mature BenRiach fizzy spiciness on the back palate. Can’t help but feel that this would have been a great 30 year old. £95",146.0,81,50.2,1.0
3674,Dave Broom,"Not often seen as a single bottling, here we have Speyside’s modernist distillery in typically delicate guise, with plenty of subtle florals (think hyacinth and daffodils), something which is amplified with water. Imagine a cool day in early spring and you are pretty much there. The mouth is clean and fresh, with a little acidity. Water doesn’t damage the palate delivery, but neither does it particularly enhance things. A sorbet rather than a meal. £65",108.0,81,50.2,1.0
3675,John Hansell,"The most intense of the Orphan Barrel initial release.  Very robust, with leather, tobacco, and roasted nuts. Quite spicy and resinous too. Toffee, maple syrup, and caramel struggle to soothe all this robustness, but the oak maintains the upper hand.  A digestif, perhaps, after a large meal? Unless you are purchasing for a piece of bourbon history, my advice would be to try it before you buy because, while complex, it is also quite woody.",150.0,81,45.35,2.0
3676,Lew Bryson,"Simple nose of corn, oak, cinnamon candy, and ash. Candy sweet, grainy, still simple, and a bit thin; increasingly hot at the end. Needs more breadth and depth, but there’s nothing seriously flawed. I’d characterize this as a good flyweight boxer caught in a cruiserweight bout; nice footwork, solid performance, and dealing some good hits, but the bigger, older bourbons give it a palate-pounding.

Flavors of sweet malt and maple pierced in a needle-row with bitter hop resins, pine, pith; malt/hop/malt/hop comes in quick waves. Like some double IPAs, this is a blunt instrument that simply walks up and wallops you with hops and malt; neither subtle nor particularly complex. Hop fans may well love it; others will not.

Not terribly complex, but enjoyable.",40.0,81,45.0,3.0
3682,Lew Bryson,"Very sweet and simple aroma, like plain jelly beans, with only a whisper of the heat you’d expect at 45%. Better on the tongue; proper heat, some cornpone, a bed of oak. Smooth, good balance, good finish. Nothing stands out, but nicely made. Loses points on the nose, and typifies the Small Producer Dilemma: why bottle a good bourbon? Beam and Heaven Hill do that already, cheaper than you ever will. Sourced whiskey.",32.0,81,45.0,3.0
3683,Fred Minnick,"With its straw color, this looks nothing like a 6 year old, but its aroma and taste justify the age statement. Caramel-covered popcorn, cooked grains, Nutella, honey, and toasted rye bread. No one flavor overpowers another as an assortment of sweet and spice project over a chewy mouthfeel. The medium finish shows decent caramel. This is nice, but doesn’t wow the palate. Sourced whiskey.",55.0,81,46.0,2.0
3684,Lew Bryson,"Nose is a bit perfumed, like doilies at grandma's house, with grain, grass, and meadow notes.

Sweetness makes me curious about the fermentation attenuation…but this would be good with seltzer.",49.0,81,50.5,3.0
3686,Dave Broom,"The recent official release of Aultmore means that malt lovers are finally aware of the distillery’s intense grassy/perfumed character, and it is these characters which are prominent here, alongside a very light sherried note in the background. There appears to be real complexity on the nose for such a young example, but water shows this to be the influence of the octave cask, which unravels slightly when water is added. Have it neat, and enjoy it a lot. £54",82.0,81,52.7,1.0

3691,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A mild nose with hints of caramel and dry grasses just vaguely suggests the flavors that wait in the glass. The sweetness of navel oranges and slow-developing peppery notes lead into the classic Canadian combination of caramel, cloves, ginger, and white pepper. Earthy vegetal tones, almost like riverweeds, and a strong but pleasant bitterness are glazed with creamy Mackintosh caramel. Dusty grain and pepper fade quickly in a shortish finish.",17.0,81,40.0,4.0
3693,Lew Bryson,"Beautiful little bottle and label. 100% rye, aged 2 years in 53-gallon heavy char oak barrels. Smells right: rye spice, orange candies, and oaky vanilla. Light body, quite hot, and the sweetness comes through, but the rye really turns it up as the liquid spreads on the tongue and warms. Some plastic hints high in the mouth. Promising, but not there yet; part of the problem with big barrels.",28.0,81,45.0,
3694,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Fairly simple, with strong butterscotch, hints of humbugs, burnt sugar, and red fruits. Lovely intro though, with petrichor: the vaguely vegetal scent of new rain and old punky logs.

Finishes with pleasing, fading, bitter citrus pith.",25.0,81,40.0,4.0
3695,Lew Bryson,"Fresh oak nose, with hard candies and bitter grass notes. Much less oaky on the tongue, but the hard candies—spicy-sweet, a bit hot—burst in the mouth, leading down to a warm, pastry-sweet finish with a wreathing of ashes. Boozy and warm, and a bit simple, but quite drinkable for a young bourbon.",65.0,81,45.0,3.0
3696,Lew Bryson,"Nose is tight, closed, what’s there is like a raisin bun; softly sweet pastry and dried fruit. Gentle in the mouth, warming but not hot; still like the pastry, but with oak framing and some nuts and a hint of anise. (375 ml.)",35.0,81,45.0,3.0
3697,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Starts off quite confectionary, with sweet top notes of vanilla, crème caramel, and violets. The palate flaunts its brash youth, showing lots of primary, new make whiskey character, while carrying its 100 proof surprisingly well for such a young whiskey (aged less than 1 year), as the cereal grain, cinnamon spice, generous sweetness, and charcoal power through the palate.

3702,Susannah Skiver Barton,"Grassy aromas mingle with white pepper, honeysuckle, jasmine, and newsprint on the nose.

Layers of malty sweetness (honey, butterscotch, caramel, vanilla wafers) is the dominant feature of this whisky, with background notes of almonds, toasted oak, and citrus fruit. Herbal, hay notes also emerge from time to time. This is not an overly complex whisky. It is also a tad fiery at times (alluding to its youthful age), but this whisky is an improvement over a previous sample I tasted from this distillery a year or two ago.",80.0,80,43.0,4.0
3709,John Hansell,"Aged in fast-growth wood. Quite the antithesis of the “Fine Grain Oak” release above; the comparison is interesting. Darker fruit (plum, blackberry), and darker sugars (maple syrup, toffee). Resinous and becoming quickly dry on the palate, with leather, tobacco leaves, grape-stem tannins, barrel char, and dried spice. A heavier, more textural bourbon than the Fine Grain Oak expression. I like this whiskey a lot until the dry, leathery oak notes begin to dominate the latter half of the palate. That, my friend, is the coarse grain oak in action.",47.0,80,45.0,2.0

Earthy, with blackberry and fruitcake, and sooty peatiness in the background. While there’s a medicinal/herbal note with water, the palate has a damp wood edge.

Ardmore remains one of the few Speyside whiskies made with peat-smoked malt. Chewy, almost oily-textured, with sweet notes of toffee and caramel up front, followed by emerging damp, earthy peat and bourbon-like notes. The oaky, resinous bourbon lingers through the finish.

   General Comments: The lack of chill-filtering certainly makes this whisky more flavorful and dynamic than its filtered brethren. It also tastes a little more mature.

3722,Dave Broom,"Drawn from a refill barrel, this is Balvenie all eager and bright at the start of its journey. It’s like an excited kid eating pancakes and runny honey (with a squeeze of lemon juice) at breakfast on her first day of school.

But, for the money, I prefer the BenRiach 25 year old (or even the 30 year old) to this whisky. Deeply layered oak -- from dried, spicy oak to juicy, damp oak.

3726,Dave Broom,"Or ‘Fumabat Porticus’ as it should be called—smoky whisky in a port cask—not that you need to be told that when you see the color. The port takes the upper hand on the nose, giving a layer of black raspberry, sloe, and cranberry sauce. The smoke hangs in the background. This juicy fruitiness carries through to the tongue where the smoke now adds much-required dry balance. The higher alcohol also stops it becoming too jammy. £59",93.0,80,50.0,1.0
3727,Dave Broom,"Here is Benrinnes in very summery guise, with its signature meatiness barely discernible. Instead you get lots of thyme, rosemary, and dried citrus peel.

This third release does not disappoint in the smoke department, while the nose also shows some orange zest aromas. That said, it is a little restrained, showing its youth with a pea pod-like character on the palate, while its fruits are emerging but aren’t fully ripened. More of a strong breeze than a tempest. £50",80.0,80,55.6,1.0
3729,Dave Broom,"Though the color suggests good cask activity, the initial approach shows a dram that seems slightly unfocused and youthful. There are some kernel-like cereal elements and very little smokiness, with touches of salt and oil. The feeling is that it’s only starting to blossom — and there is a floral element — and has been bottled too early. It’s all very focused, lifted, and aromatic, but when compared to the Adelphi you can’t help but wonder whether the same distillery is involved.   £55 (500 ml)",85.0,80,52.9,1.0
3730,Dave Broom,"Light gold in color, the roasted almond notes that start the nose show the influence of the amontillado sherry finish before your nose is filled with the contents of a spice merchant’s chest alongside, unusually, a light maritime note. Very gentle and clean in the mouth with sour plum and a generally amenable nature. More like this please, Burn Stewart! £60",94.0,80,54.3,1.0
3731,Dave Broom,"Stiùireadair means “helmsman” in Gaelic. This has been finished for a year in Marsala casks. The nose is all garden compost, moist vegetation, light smoke, and highly oxidized: like a young vin santo (or indeed Marsala). Very nutty, with an almost vermouth-like quality. The palate is all clove, anise, cherry stone. Those oxidized wine notes are so dominant it’s shifted the balance toward the finish. This particular helmsman’s somewhat off course. £95",160.0,80,56.6,1.0
3732,Dave Broom,"Bunnahabhain’s peaty expression is steadily coming together. It’s been one of those drams that seems to need more time than many, but that’s true of Bunna’ in general, come to think of it. In fact, the peatiness is quite mild on the nose, adding some scent to the sandalwood elements and obvious raisined sweetness. There’s a slightly cheesy note in the background and a touch of sulphur on the palate. It’s not quite wholly integrated, but progressing well. (Fèis Ìle 2016, 833 bottles) £95",123.0,80,52.7,1.0
3733,Dave Broom,"Originally a one-off bottling for Friends of the Classic Malts, ‘Moch’ (Gaelic for dawn, though the association between daybreak and the dram is beyond me — one for the morning ‘skailk’ maybe?) appears to have taken the place of the Cask Strength expression. It shows a saline, seashell-like freshness, light smoke. and a pleasant mix of salami and grassiness. The palate is clean and intense with a continuation of that oyster liquor character. Great in a smoky Highball. £36",57.0,80,43.0,1.0
3734,Dave Broom,"The finish in question here is Muscatel casks and you can tell that from the start, as the nose is filled with a rich, sweet, and very pronounced dusky fruitiness — sloes and plums. The smoke as a result is diminished as are the grassy/bacony notes. While the smoke does emerge from its fruity bubble on the tongue, the effect is almost liqueur-like. It’s a very pleasing dram, but the question is, is it Caol Ila?",81.0,80,43.0,1.0
3735,Dave Broom,"Quite hot on the nose, with a little oak on show here alongside garam masala. The effect is of dried fish and seaweed, Brazil nut and bread basket. It needs water. In the mouth it’s tense when neat, giving you the sense of it straining to express itself fully but being constricted by alcohol. Firm and bold, but even with water it’s a little too dry.",275.0,80,53.2,1.0
3736,John Hansell,"This Speyside distillery was closed in 1983. Very pale in color, mouth-coating, but not heavy or cloying. A clean whisky that emphasizes its sweeter notes, with honeyed malt, ripe barley, butterscotch, and vanilla. Subtle notes of cinnamon, lemon grass, and fruit in syrup. A dried, oak-spice finish provides balance.",200.0,80,57.1,1.0
3737,John Hansell,"Very fragrant and perfumed on the nose. Chewy and syrupy on the palate, with layers of sweetness (toffee, caramel, fudge), roasted almonds, and raisins. A drying, resinous spice finish saves the sweetness from being too dominant. Call me sentimental, but I just remembered the old Campbell Distillers 10 year old bottling which expressed so much more finesse, and was cleaner and not as heavy and cluttered.",65.0,80,46.0,1.0
3738,John Hansell,"This Glencraig, along with Mosstowie (reviewed below), were experimentations with ""Lomond"" stills, where the top of the stills were replaced with a rectifying column, allowing several different styles of whiskies to be produced at the same distillery. The Lomond stills were eventually removed. This is a very creamy malt, with an oily texture. Notes of bananas and cream, ripe barley, caramel, graham cracker, and orange creamsicle. Dry, spicy finish. The fruity zing in this whisky shows that it still has some life in it. A dessert whisky indeed.",200.0,80,54.4,1.0

This distillery is located amongst the fertile barley-growing fields of the Laich O’Moray. Though modern in look, it actually dates back to 1810. This is a classic introduction to its fresh, zesty style, which plays an important role in the Ballantine’s blends. Think cut grass, green apple, pine, pear drops, and a whiff of freshly-starched linen. This energy carries on to the mouth where apple is the dominant flavor, along with green walnut and a zippy acidity. £34",54.0,80,54.5,
3740,Gavin Smith,"Fresh citrus notes and pear drops on the nose, plus a newly-opened packet of printer paper. The palate is quite full-bodied and fruity, with some white pepper.

3741,Dominic Roskrow,"This isn’t the easiest to fall for. It’s stewed, swampy, a big, feisty, take-no-prisoners whisky with oxtail soup, spicy tomato and meat broth on the nose, then black treacle, praline, cayenne, and paprika. A rootsy prune juice is part of the finish. Challenging and tough. £67 [Dominic Roskrow]",104.0,80,60.5,1.0
3742,Dominic Roskrow,"Another whisky that will not disappoint fans of the brand, but it doesn’t do enough to bring any converts on board. The nose is fresh and sweet, with barley and ginger and not much else. The taste is perfectly acceptable, and at this strength better than the standard bottling. Water brings out a sweet malt and barley core, some gentle spice, and a rich sweetness.",97.0,80,59.3,1.0
3743,Dave Broom,"Think of sponge fingers soaked in cream and you’re not far off the initial aroma. Add in light macadamia-like nuttiness, a drift of mint, and Glenlivet’s signature apple — core, not green. As it opens, it becomes woodier, like a brush pile. The palate has sweet, pure, pear-like fruit that initially keeps the oak in balance. It seems to need water, but when it’s added the oak takes over. Good, but a little tired. £102",160.0,80,48.8,1.0
3744,John Hansell,"A single cask bottling of The Glenrothes aged in a first-fill sherry cask. Only 519 bottles, all destined for the U.S. It is the richest, chewiest, sweetest, and fruitiest of all the Glenrothes whiskies reviewed here. Deep mahogany color, with notes of toffee apples, waxed fruit, burnt orange, prunes in syrup, and dark chocolate. The intensity of the sherry and length of oak-aging gives the whisky a flavor profile that begins to transcend traditional whisky flavors, expressing notes of port wine, pot-still rum, and rancio.",995.0,80,43.0,1.0
3745,John Hansell,"Caramelized, fruity notes of mandarin, pineapple, golden raisin, and plum. Heathery honey notes add an additional sweet dimension, as do some light toffee and nougat.

3746,John Hansell,"A whisky very typical of this distillery, which has been silent since 1998. Rich and thick on the nose and palate; oozing vanilla, ripe malt, cotton candy, powdered sugar, new-mown hay, and lemon tart. Cinnamon, evergreen, and a wisp of smoke round out the palate. An evolving whisky -- starts out heavy and sweet, then turns clingingly dry. A fun, rare whisky for a reasonable price.",30.0,80,40.0,

3749,Gavin Smith,"Surprisingly the most reticent nose of the three Inchmurrins. Mild orchard fruit, apple blossom, cocoa powder, and a hint of nutmeg.

The finish is long, spicy, dry, and oaky, with persistent background fruitiness trying to break through.",90.0,80,46.0,1.0
3750,Gavin Smith,"Despite close proximity to Islay, stylistically Jura make has far more in common with its Highland cousins. The entry level 10 year old variant offers resin, oil, cereal, and pine notes on the delicate nose.

3751,Dave Broom,"A mix of bourbon and quarter casks finished in Pedro Ximenez, this new release is, initially, only for Travel Retail. The problem with finishing peaty whiskies is that all you can do is reduce the smoke, but here it’s done with as much subtlety as you can when dealing with PX. Think treacle scones, raisins, and tarry tobacco. A thick mid-palate gives an effect like an old-fashioned medicine. A sweet-hearted dragon smoldering in its seashore cave. (Travel Retail exclusive) £60",94.0,80,48.0,1.0
3752,Dave Broom,"The annual Cairdeas release aims to show Laphroaig in a new light. Initially I thought this too sweet and cask dominated, with the distillery battling against the wine—fresh red fruit and seaweed is a test, even for the best chef. Add water and give it time though, and there is this lightly exotic, herbal, hazelnut-like element. It lacks depth and the tarry thump beloved by many Laphroaig lovers, but is an interesting departure.",75.0,80,51.6,1.0
3753,John Hansell,"Sweet, ripe barley, balanced by damp peat, tar, and burning embers. Some spice notes (pepper, anise) linger on the finish.

3755,Dave Broom,"The latest in Chivas Bros. no age statement (NAS) variant of their malts and while the nose here does have Longmorn’s fruity elements, they are discreet.

3757,Dave Broom,"There’s a Roman dish involving lamb cooked in milk, and this is it in alcohol form. A slightly peculiar lactic note rises and falls above the rich meatiness of the spirit. There’s a hit of pencil shavings, but with water it becomes cheesy. So much more straightforward on the tongue with good vinous weight, like an old Vin Jaune. It finishes with earthy tones. It’s just…odd. £125",201.0,80,55.8,1.0
3758,John Hansell,"Very pale in color. A creamy, mouthcoating whisky, with thick vanilla as the main thread. Quite dry, given its creaminess.

3759,John Hansell,"A very traditional Rosebank-aged in a refill hogshead and bottled fairly young (12 years old). Rosebank is one of the better, yet lesser known Lowland single malts. Since the distillery was closed down in 1993, it will continue being unfamiliar to most, and finding young Rosebanks like this one will become increasingly more difficult. Here’s one at cask strength. The whisky turns very cloudy with the addition of water due to lack of chill filtering, but the additional water brings out the whisky’s subtle aromas and flavors-fresh cut grass, hay, delicate fruit, and a gentle malty sweetness. Ironically, I actually enjoyed some of the recent young G&M Rosebanks bottled at 40% ABV better than this one-their flavors were cleaner, brighter, and more refined. Still, this is a fair representation of the Lowland style.",80.0,80,,1.0
3760,Gavin Smith,"A new NAS expression from Scapa on Orkney, matured entirely in first-fill American oak casks. An initial hint of lime cordial, then musty peaches, almonds, cinnamon, and table salt.

Toffee, vanilla fudge, roasted chestnuts, and nougat, enhanced by glazed peaches, burnt pineapple, dark cherry pits, and subtle anise. Gripping charred oak tannins emerge mid-palate and continue on the finish detracting from an otherwise very pleasant experience. (Bottled exclusively for Binny’s Beverage Depot)",75.0,80,58.2,1.0
3762,Gavin Smith,"Douglas Laing has added a no age statement bottling of Talisker to its Provenance range, tagging it as “Young and Feisty.” It comprises whisky from casks #10227 and 10229.

3765,Dave Broom,"Light amber. The nose offers up walnut bread, spelt flour, and a green, malty note. Overall, it’s slightly unyielding, with toasted oak, hazelnut, and barley. Water opens up a sweeter core: Lucozade, apricot kernel, and barley. The palate is where the apricot flesh turns up, but then it firms up quickly, snuffing that moment of levity out. Water introduces lemon before it becomes very gingery on the finish. It’s the thing about Tormore; it just can’t let itself go. (France only) €42",55.0,80,43.0,1.0
3767,Fred Minnick,"A blend of straight bourbons. Light straw color. An expressive dark cherry, cooked grains, and wood nose opens up to a bevy of custard, roasted pine nuts, and herbs, with hints of tobacco and smoked hazelnuts. A grain-forward approach leaves it slightly unbalanced, until roasted nuts save the day with a tinge of vanilla and caramel-flavored popcorn. Sourced whiskey.",35.0,80,46.0,
3772,Dave Broom,"A slightly perfumed nose offers up the slightly unusual pairing of dried lavender, sweet-cured herring, and then potpourri air freshener. This flies off to show wet dulse on warm sand. It starts sweetly with some nutmeg, then hot peppers. The smoke is very light, allowing a tantalizing glimpse of soft guava before the salinity returns. Water brings out the peat kiln but also that initial perfume. Muddled. £700",1113.0,80,46.0,1.0
3773,Dave Broom,"Quite a solid start for a Caol Ila which, like the 30 year old (see above), pitches you into the farmyard, though this time it’s a sheep-shearing shed. There’s also some bacon and spent barbecue. The initial impression is of a pretty dry example, but some oil begins to seep through. The palate is explosive with some engine oil, becoming pretty flinty with violet notes, and the distillery sweetness is hidden. A little disjointed. £135",215.0,80,46.0,1.0
3775,Lew Bryson,"Pale, almost peach color. Light aromas of caramel, sweet citrus. Tastes of sweet caramel, faint bite of oak on the end. Simple, but clean and pleasant. You’d have to be careful mixing this — it would get lost easily — but it should be nice on the rocks or with seltzer.",14.0,80,,4.0
3777,Dave Broom,"The oldest of the new trio, here you can see how the smoke has become fully absorbed, accenting the peapod and spearmint, giving depth to the still-fresh ozonic elements. There are light levels of complexity, even a little chocolate. The tongue, when neat, goes deep into pear and apple, but it’s edgy. Adding water, however, shows the lack of oak integration. I’d want more from a whisky of this age (and price). £199",302.0,80,51.1,1.0
3778,Dave Broom,"As with the 30 year old, here you get the sense of smoke being absorbed rather than being expressive. There’s not a lot of cask at work here—this has real minerality, and an oily brininess bringing to mind a hot outboard motor on a fishing trip. Halfway in a fire ignites, sending clouds of smoke forward, but then it dries too quickly. Good, but just not enough oak to give it depth and length. £80",122.0,80,50.4,1.0
3780,Dave Broom,"One of the newest of the Distillers Edition family. Here, Royal Lochnagar has been given its secondary resting period in Muscat casks. That nodule of sweetness in the 12 year old has been picked up and extended into a more perfumed world; think blueberry muffin and boysenberry jam. The slight sour/bitter note is a positive, but I think in this case that the finish dominates proceedings and needs to be scaled down a little. £48",75.0,80,40.0,1.0
3781,Dave Broom,"Another Glen Moray, this time in a substantially different guise than normal. Yes, this is fresh, sweet, and malty — to be precise, draff-like — but there’s smoke as well, and a fairly decent belt of it. Young it may be — amazingly it’s less than 2 years old — but the palate, especially with water, is cleansing and with vanilla, good phenols, and orris-like dryness. Very intriguing. £18 (200 ml)",28.0,80,60.6,1.0
3782,Dave Broom,"The onionskin hue gives the initial indication that this was finished in a port pipe. The nose is light and fruity: raspberry and cranberry juice, even a sprig of mint. Fresh, but with a background funkiness. In time, there’s ripe melon, then lightly musty wood comes through. The palate is light, giving the effect of diluted fruit juice. It’s all just a bit lacking in weight. £25",56.0,80,40.0,1.0
3788,Fred Minnick,"Wood. From the lumberyard to the charred barrels, wood powers over grain, caramel, vanilla, and earth. A nuttiness comes through, turning the wood into almond, pine nut, and pecan, but a resounding bitterness stays in the form of nut shells. It lacks balance and complementary flavors to the oak, but caramel finds itself on a short finish. Decent first release, but I wanted to find more nuance from the second barrel.",22.0,80,43.0,2.0
3789,Fred Minnick,"Grain in several forms begin this experience. First it’s raw corn kernels, freshly buttered popcorn, boiled oats, rye toast, and cornbread.

3796,Dave Broom,"The double maturation here is a vatting of bourbon and sherry casks finished off in what Diageo will only say is a “special” cask. That’s helpful. There’s a breakfast-style opening here of warm bagels with grape jelly, then comes citrus, before some of that dusky distillery character creeps in.

3801,Dave Broom,"A similar story to the 30 year old. Despite a truly excellent nose, this time more sherry influences dominate: think of polished wood, damsons, and a little menthol/camphor and resinous oak. Once again, the palate seems to be slightly dumber than I’d want from a venerable whisky that should be about elegant, complex expression. It’s balanced, just a little faded. Again, maybe higher strength might have done the trick. £140",220.0,80,40.0,1.0

All the right parts are here: corn, vanilla, wood, even some mint, and no serious off-flavors, but it's a rough road. Definitely needs some more time in the barrel, but that should do it some good.

3812,Lew Bryson,"Interesting: “Bottled by The Tennessee Spirits Company, Pewaukee, WI.” Woody nose, spiked with dry rye spiciness: black pepper, dried mint. My, that’s hot. It’s a rye rocket, and the wood’s drying up every bit of sweet here, leaving my tongue wrinkly.

3816,Lew Bryson,"Wood-smoked malt, a spirit aged in oak with fruitwood chips added makes for a distinctive, idiosyncratic whisky. Nose is warehouse reek, mellow fruitwood smoke, and sweet, light pipe tobacco, with a slight hint of cinnamon. Mouth is hot, but soft, with lots of malt and that unfamiliar flow of fruitwood smoke. Thin and edgy up front, but as the smoke spreads and the malt sweetens, it evolves. Finish is a bit abrupt.",37.0,80,48.0,3.0
3817,Fred Minnick,"Initially, it’s earth and fruit. This develops into sawdust, more earth, and bananas.

Tastes like a lower row barrel. Finish is also sweet. Not a lot of complexity. Sourced whiskey, from Dickel.",30.0,80,40.0,2.0
3829,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Dry grain fills the air on first pour. This clear unaged whisky just gushes feed mill aromas. The all-wheat spirit is distilled from grain grown in a single Ontario field, then coarse-milled for making whisky. Sweet, creamy, and oh so peppery hot, it fades from citrus fruit and bitter black licorice to absolute nothingness. Our forefathers drank new make whisky. Let’s hope it was as tasty as this one.

3830,Davin de Kergommeaux,"This is the latest in an ongoing series of organic, single-field white whiskies from Toronto distillery. In 2013, summer rains imbued Ontario spring wheat with softer, nuttier, and more complex flavors than 2012. These show here on the nose as lemon oil, fragrant spring violets, and newly harvested grain. A sweet, spicy palate is alive with real lemons, yellow plums, fresh straw, and sweet, lingering white pepper. Mouth coating and big. (Ontario only) C$40/375 ml.",37.0,80,50.0,4.0
3831,Lew Bryson,"Unaged, triple distilled spirit, produced and bottled at Piedmont Distillers in North Carolina. Clean nose with hints of unripe honeydew, bond paper, and wet crushed chalk. Very soft on the palate, clean, with no burn at all. Slippery-smooth, a tiny bit sweet. Tastes like good vodka, really; not much grain here at all. Easy to drink, but…where’s the excitement?",22.0,80,40.0,3.0
3832,Lew Bryson,"Mason jar packaging makes for an awkward pour; had to be said. Nose is hot, with a fruity sweetness and fainter notes of grassy green corn, flowers, and rock. Clean and sweet, with more corn character here, along with other fresh grains. Not nasty, not bad, but seems to be mostly aimed as a base for Palmetto’s apple pie and peach flavors. Otherwise…it’s sweet, corn-tinged vodka.",24.0,80,52.5,3.0
3833,Davin de Kergommeaux,"An all-rye grain mash yields this almost tequila-like whisky that was blended to tempt the agave-blessed Mexican palate. Hot, earthy, and somewhat muddy, with the black pepper signature of tequila, it gradually becomes sweet and creamy with vague hints of black licorice. Strong herbal undertones suggest dill pickles. Hard slatey rye grain softens into blue clay. The sintering heat lingers right to the end, as do earthiness and agave-like black pepper ¡Hola! (Mexico only) 99 Mexican pesos",7.5,80,40.0,4.0
3834,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Sweet creamy toffee, with hot and spicy undertones, builds gradually to a peak then fades into classic bitter pith. Caramels mute the hardness of rye grain as it, too fades in advancing waves of gingery pepper. Definitely a mixing whisky now, Lord Calvert tells one and all that their cocktail was made with wood-aged whisky. Hints of grassiness and dry white wine add breadth to a whisky that in days long past was intended to be sipped neat.",10.0,80,40.0,4.0
3836,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The nose is slow to open up, and when it does it reveals simple rye spices and butterscotch. These become primary flavor notes on tasting. Biting spices burst onto a buttery palate before a pleasing bitterness seeps in. The second sip seems almost nutty and sweet, with pralines and thick cream. This 10 year old blend of all-wheat and rye-grain whiskies is simple, but displays its age with such subtleties as fading orange water and woodsy herbal notes. (Canada only) C$25",20.0,80,40.0,4.0
3837,Dave Broom,"Light gold. Fresh and clean, with light draff notes. Cool porcelain, lemon, cereal husk. It becomes more expressive on the tongue, though it remains subtle. A bit of a stealth bomb because the palate shows plenty of spice, cinnamon toast, and baklava. The finish reveals some green notes. When you add water, it becomes incredibly minty. Fragile, but if you fancy a Bunna' julep, then look no further. £69",105.0,80,48.4,1.0
3838,Dave Broom,"Pale straw. The nose is very draff-like/sweet mash, then green herbal notes, reminiscent of angelica. The palate remains light and slightly hot on the tongue, with some cereal and a certain fatness. Water brings out a little more from the cask. A delicate and pleasant enough dram, but I’m slightly bemused as to why it’s being bottled at this age when there’s clearly so much more to give. £69",101.0,80,46.0,1.0
3839,Dave Broom,"Very pale straw. The color indicates that there’s been no real cask activity. A little closed on the nose to start; clean, quite green and leafy (young ferns). The flavor however, makes up for this, with good mid-palate sweetness and some dark fruits beginning to assemble themselves in the middle. Of interest to completists. £45",66.0,80,46.0,1.0
3840,Gavin Smith,"Another youthful offering from Douglas Laing in its Premier Barrel series, presented in one of 863 ceramic decanters. This Glengoyne initially offers a nose of cherries and treacle before tinned tomatoes make their presence felt. Tangy fruits on the palate, malt, and spicy sausage. Caramel, spices, and a hint of oak in the finish. An interesting contrast to the older, more sherry cask-focused Glengoyne ‘house’ bottlings. £65",95.0,80,46.0,1.0
3841,Gavin Smith,"Following a similarly youthful Provenance range bottling of Talisker, and an NAS “Young and Feisty” variant, Douglas Laing has opted to release this 5 year old expression in its Premier Barrel lineup, complete with ceramic decanter, 495 of which were produced. Initially meaty, then peat smoke envelops the nose, with damp tweed backing it up. Black pepper and gunpowder tea on the bold palate; flinty, with lemon and lime. Lingering black pepper and a metallic tang in the finish. £75",110.0,80,46.0,1.0
3843,Dave Broom,"There is something very bedtime drink about this Glenallachie, without it being a dram to have before retiring for the night. It’s to do with the aromatic sensation of powdered malted milk and cocoa powder. The palate is simple, with some fresh apple, pear juice, and a lightly sour edge. The draff/malted milk re-emerges in the middle of the tongue. With water, pears come through, making it similar to a tequila blanco. All rather delicate. £63",105.0,80,47.9,1.0
3844,John Hansell,"A straightforward bourbon that takes few risks but also offers few rewards. You’ll find a mélange of orange, apricot, sweet corn, vanilla, soft spice and honey. Light, youthful finish, with a kiss of oak. Sourced whiskey.",35.0,80,40.0,2.0
3846,Lew Bryson,"Bottle 170 of this Delaware distillery’s first batch. Full, oily aroma of sweet, wet, crushed corn; almost too rich. Very clean on the palate; light and sweet, a bit of dry leafiness. Impressive first effort. (Delaware only)",25.0,80,40.0,3.0
3847,Lew Bryson,"A locally-grown mashbill of 75% barley, 20% malt, 5% oats. Very aromatic for unaged spirit: fresh, grainy, a bit feinty/vegetal, split rock, and a note like well-rinsed crisp sauerkraut. It’s a quick and lively one in the mouth, sweet and slippery, grain and hints of fresh herbs (fennel, mace, white peppercorn). The finish is a bit sticky—the oats, maybe—and sweet. Interesting stuff.",40.0,80,50.0,3.0
3848,Davin de Kergommeaux,"My goodness, this woman is an innovator. Distillery owner Sophia Pantazi stored her maple syrup in whisky barrels. Then once the syrup was bottled, she refilled those barrels with whisky spirit, giving maple-aged whisky. Grain, chocolate, and winter-welcome glowing spices quickly overtake a malty, grainy, perfumey note characteristic of young whisky. Though creamy sweet, the whisky has more toffee notes than maple syrup. Hot beyond its ABV and wanting a couple more years’ maturation. (Distillery only) Price is per 375 ml.",33.0,80,40.0,4.0
3849,Geoffrey Kleinman,"A blend of 94% rye-mash whiskey and Virgil Kane's High-Rye Bourbon (60% corn, 36% rye, and 4% barley). Floral rye grain spice bursts from the nose along with cedar plank and graphite. The entry is thick and sweet, with maple syrup, young oak, and rye spice. Things don't heat up until the end of the mid-palate where a dash of heat drives a long, spicy finish. An interesting mix of flavors that could benefit from a little more complexity.",35.0,80,45.5,
3852,Lew Bryson,"Another experimental “Whims” bottlings; this one is 95% malted rye and 5% malted barley. Nose is sharp, with notes of cinnamon candies and a bit of solvents. Better on the palate: a cooling breeze of minty rye, some citrus, and growing bitter rye oil as it finishes. Fairly simple, pleasant stuff, but the nose is not inviting. Price is per 375 ml.",34.0,80,46.0,3.0
3853,Lew Bryson,"A “whiskey distilled from rye malt mash,” which indicates aging in used barrels. Still has a deep coloring from port barrel finishing. Nose is quite peppery, youthfully vegetal, and sweet with fruit, again, presumably from the port barrel. Rye grassiness and spice in the mouth, wrapped with layers of port fruit and pepperiness that roll into the finish. Smooth for the strength, though the port is pushy and the flavors could be better balanced. An interesting direction.",35.0,80,47.5,3.0
3854,Gavin Smith,"This could be seen as a brave young bottling of the sometimes divisive Fettercairn single malt, but Glenkeir Treasures has acquired some interesting casks which showcase the youthful whisky to good advantage. Wet cardboard, starch, and savory notes on the initial nose, settling down to something fruitier and with milk chocolate. Floral, nutty, and slightly peppery on the palate, with almonds, toffee, cocoa powder, and gentle citrus fruit. Quite soft in the finish, with elegant spices and milky coffee. (Whisky Shop only) £35/500 ml",53.0,80,40.0,1.0
3855,Lew Bryson,"Well, they got the proof right! From JEM Beverage (Carrollton, Texas). Sweet cedar and citrus in the nose, dominant and one-noted. Sweet on the tongue, with that fresh green cedar character and more sweet citrus; a touch of oak in the finish. Not a lot else.",33.0,80,40.0,3.0
3856,Lew Bryson,"Redesigned label, wincingly generic in looks, even for a bottom-shelf 80 proofer. Whiskey’s quite light in color, and smells young as well: sweet, a wheated bourbon hint of peanuts, and just the faintest hint of wood. Mouth is warm, softly corny, and a little bittersweet on the finish. But that’s it. Just not much going on here.",13.0,80,40.0,2.0
3857,Dave Broom,"Like being stuck inside the Dailuaine dark grains plant: all Marmite (yeast extract spread), deglazed roasting pan, and a cereal note. In other words, the distillery character is the major contributor. Some light nuttiness, but overall this is Dailuaine in funky guise. Becomes more, errr…agricultural with water. Robust and peppery on the tongue. A nice example, albeit without massive complexity.",140.0,80,57.5,1.0
3859,Gavin Smith,"This expression from Macduff distillery was launched along with its 12 and 18 year old siblings in 2015. The nose is fresh and floral and offers light cereal notes and soft malt. The palate yields new-mown hay, toffee apples, and quite sweet oak. The finish is medium in length and softly spiced. (France only) €21",24.0,80,40.0,1.0
3860,Lew Bryson,"A blend of two MGP bourbons, 11% 2 year old, 89% 4 year old. Simple sweet corn nose, with some cinnamon and hard candies; hot for 40%. Underwhelming for a whiskey named for President Jackson; warm and sweet, though with some oak-based bitterness at the fringes. Stays sweet through the finish. Not flawed, but not well thought-out either. Might be the blandest MGP juice I’ve ever had. Sourced whiskey.",30.0,80,40.0,2.0
3862,Lew Bryson,"The name is a reference to the “whisk(e)y” convention; this is a malt spirit, aged in a used American rye whiskey barrel. Light amber. Light nose of baker's chocolate, barrel, fruit candy, and boiled frosting. Spicy and prickly on the tongue (the rye?), with calming influence from the barrel. A lively swallow, sweet, spicy, a whack of cut lumber, and the sweetness of young malt. But there's a roughness that's not all fun; good spirit, needs more taming.",50.0,80,50.0,
3863,Lew Bryson,"Unaged spirit, and smells like it: rich grain, a bit of loose-cut funkiness. Quite sweet in the mouth, more body than usual.

3864,Lew Bryson,"Riffing on the German smoked beer type. Light smoke and caramel on the nose. Very grassy front, the smoke slips in toward the middle, and it all ends up a bit confused, like dessert served in an ashtray. (375 ml.)",35.0,80,45.0,3.0
3865,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Rich copper in color, following just 55 weeks in a 17-gallon barrel at low proof (106.2), this whiskey is caught between youth and ambition, as flavors of leathery oak, earth, dried apple, and dates emerge to meet green twigs and briar, and some musty basement. Generous and broad-shouldered, this rye aims high, with solid structure and robust spice, but is overwhelmed by dusty, bitterly tannic oak on the finish.",65.0,80,43.0,3.0
3867,Dave Broom,"Comus is the name of a frankly terrifying English folk group who taps into the dark, pagan spirit underpinning that music. An apposite name then for the Laddie’s most heavily-peated variant. If you want to know what it’s like to stand beside a kiln, then sniff this, but the distillery’s sweetness is retained, here in the guise of pineapple and banana. The palate is like eucalyptus lozenges, with light maltiness before that Laddie thickness makes things even sweeter.",200.0,80,61.0,1.0
3870,Susannah Skiver Barton,"Juicy Fruit gum, Kool-Aid, sugared orange gumdrops, and candied papaya and mango meet fresh-cut lumber on the nose. The palate has notes of bruised banana and juicy guava, with assertive wood and cocoa powder to balance the sweetness.

3874,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Aromas hint at a bitterly astringent, almost burnt sugar smell, like green walnut hulls. While the body is full and rich, it’s simply too hot and young to make for pleasant drinking. The finish is long and spicy, but needs more time to mellow.",85.0,79,50.0,
3875,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Generously oaky, with sawdust, horse saddle, vanilla, honey, and a chalky, mineral quality on the nose. The palate is mouth-coating, with a full-bodied punch of sweet fruit, caramel, treacle, and heat, but even with dilution, the astringent wood tannins, chalk dust, and dry leathery finish come on too quickly. The rare craft bourbon that might have been better a bit younger. (Loch & K(e)y exclusive)",45.0,79,56.55,3.0
3876,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Fruit driven, with banana and circus peanuts candies, florals, and violet candies, this turns more peppery and minty on the palate, where warm cereal meets some varnish notes with a bit of heat and slight bitterness that makes it feel a bit rough around the edges. 100% Montana and Canada rye, aged 2 years in full-sized barrels.",45.0,79,45.0,3.0
3878,Fred Minnick,"Take just a moment to admire the color; it’s nearly red after 24 years. Then admire the fragrance, with florals, fruit, caramel, and vanilla bargaining for their time over prominent oak. Complexity of earth, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla, bitter chocolate, light cinnamon, sautéed mushrooms, watermelon Jolly Rancher, and a hint of tobacco. Eventually, woodiness and bitterness set in and dominate the palate. Too much wood.",250.0,79,50.0,2.0
3880,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Distilled from corn, malted barley, rye, and flaked rye, and aged in small barrels with toasted orangewood chips.

A fine example of what it aims to be—young small-barrel whiskey.",55.0,79,45.0,3.0
3881,Fred Minnick,"A composite of 5, 7, and 8 year old Kentucky and Tennessee bourbons. It offers exceptional color at this ABV, but the grain and oak-forward nose suggests youth, with hints of medicinal boiling oatmeal and cinnamon. Slightly dry to adhesive mouthfeel is followed by menthol, heavy smoke, cinnamon-custard pie, licorice, caramel, and a hint of cherry cough syrup. With the stocks selected for this batch, I’d hoped for more, but it tastes unlike traditional bourbon. Sourced whiskey.",55.0,79,42.0,2.0
3882,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"Initial aromas of boiled corncob, sugarcane stalks, and burnt sugar give a suggestion of youth and slight bitterness. Dig a little deeper and the secondary flavors of honeyed fruit, green apple, lavender, vanilla, and fresh oak reveal potential. While clearly young, there is still a lot to admire in this soft and delicate wheated bourbon, with its hints of smoke and a mouthwatering saltwater taffy finish, possibly derived from aging in floating boathouses on Puget Sound. 375ml",27.0,79,44.0,
3883,Lew Bryson,"Small barrel-type aromas: sharp, fresh oak and hot grain, but also cocoa hulls and coffee grounds. Tastes youthfully hot, and chocolatey, and sweet, and the oak is raw and forward. More chocolate than stout, I think. (375 ml.)",35.0,79,45.0,3.0
3884,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Family-owned Domaine Pinnacle uses rye, malted barley, and corn spirits to create a lovely, if typical, Canadian blended whisky. Their 430-acre farm, just a stone’s throw from the Vermont border in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, produces award-winning apple cider too. Prune juice, raspberries, toffee, hints of coffee; lush, mild vegetal notes on the nose. Peppery, sweet, creamy, and somewhat simple. Lovely burn. Traditional Canadian whisky with a bite.

3885,Dave Broom,"A 1992 ‘Rothes finished in a peated cask, this shows immediate smoke along with some cellar notes. Behind is some laurel and a light lemon touch. It has surprising intensity. It’s all very clean and fresh, but while the smoke is there it wanders about in a somewhat distracted fashion. Like the recent Glenlivet peated cask offering it just lacks integration. Maybe if you want smoke, you should peat the barley. Who’da thunk it? £42",61.0,79,40.0,1.0
3886,Lew Bryson,"Another “green malt” whiskey from Coppersea, a method they found in an old Scottish text for making whiskey from unkilned malt.

Bitter and stemmy; hot and sweet as it closes. I much prefer the rye.",60.0,79,48.0,3.0
3887,Lew Bryson,"Woodsy, wet leaves and fallen trees, dry grain bin, and fresh-cut cherrywood aromas. Cherry and dark plum up front, passing through to cocoa and wood, and chocolate-cherry candy on the end...none of which tastes like anything I'd call “bourbon” until the very last whisper of the finish. How do you make bourbon without a hint of corn or oak to it? Some strange ideas here.",45.0,79,46.0,3.0
3888,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Dusty on the nose with increasing caramel notes. A bit spirity. A semi-sweet palate with initially mild peppers flickers into a pleasing, gingery glow. Suggestions of bitterness in the middle are subdued by increasing sweetness. Simple, but very nice. Caramel notes quickly become hot and peppery, then a smooth oiliness soothes the palate until it ends on a peppery and barely bitter finish. A great mixer with ginger ale.",15.0,79,40.0,4.0
3890,Lew Bryson,"Quite dark for 4 year old whiskey. Nose is fierce, unrestrained by the glass, and full of caramel, baking spices, and dusty corn. It’s hot and oaky, but dominated by a broad cornmeal placidity that keeps the flaming oak well in check. Water brings out mint, but brings a cloying edge to the corn; it’s better hot and rocking. A huge evaporative loss made for a tiny yield, but even so, the price just seems crazy.",199.0,79,67.5,3.0

3894,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A robust, pleasing, yet simple session whisky, 1878 is made for mixing and shooting but not for contemplation. Wet stones with some sweetness on the nose predict the almost liqueur-like sweetness of the palate. It quickly becomes hot and zippy with a white pepper payload. Before long some slight bitter pithiness creeps in, then subsides leaving crème brulée and Caramac candy bar, with a rich, almost eggy mouthfeel. The finish is short with cleansing grapefruit pith.

3895,Geoffrey Kleinman,"The bottle states “Aged less than four years” but the nose says probably less than two. Unseasoned oak and sawdust dominate the nose. If you can get through the oak you’ll find honey, corn, cinnamon, and beef jerky. On the palate it’s dry cornmeal, caramel, and a hefty portion of abrasive oak. The mid-palate is big spice with cinnamon, black pepper, clove, and oak. A short dry finish puts a bow on a whiskey that’s overly tannic, dry, and oaky.",65.0,79,43.2,3.0
3896,Lew Bryson,"Light brown sugar, orange candy, and cinnamon on the nose, along with just a hint of funk.

3898,Dave Broom,"Amber in hue, this starts off very succulent and approachable, with some butterscotch, vanilla, and caramel toffee, but like its brother, it dries. The palate is lighter than the 14 year old, and seems to float, lacking an anchor. When it does come down, it does so with a cereal crunch. Water lightens it still further, just leaving a mix of oak and cereal, and an astringent finish. (France only) €56",75.0,79,48.0,1.0
3899,Geoffrey Kleinman,"The American craft whiskey movement has produced some unique riffs on classic spirits. Here we get a classic Irish-type whiskey made in Tennessee and aged in small, 15-gallon barrels. It’s all lush Irish on the nose, with caramel, green apple, dark chocolate, oak. On the palate the oak from the small barrel overtakes caramel apple with its smoky barrel char, sawdust, and clove spice. An interesting idea, but perhaps better realized in larger or used barrels.",55.0,79,40.0,3.0
3901,Dave Broom,"Finishing in octave-sized PX casks has resulted in the creation of an oddity: the world’s first Ardbeg cordial.

There’s a lot of whisky here, though it’s light and subtle. What burns in the mouth is slippery smooth in the throat, ending in classic Canadian bitter grapefruit pith. Tasting suggestion: add ginger ale. A pleasing citron residue lingers in the empty glass.",11.0,79,40.0,4.0
3904,Lew Bryson,"Distilled from an oatmeal stout with a shot of peat, this intrigued even before the cap popped. It does smell like an oatmeal stout: cocoa, grains, fresh bread, restrained smoke, mixed with small-barrel oak. The smoke blows up in the mouth, much more evident, and the chocolaty, honey-sweet base rolls underneath…but it’s shallow, without the richness of a properly-aged scotch.

Nose is mostly young oak, like a small barrel whiskey, but there are some subtle spice notes and sweet malt. Creamy mouth, sweet but not sticky, and the orange and spice I’m picking up are likely from that yeast. Body is luscious; best part of the whiskey, because the finish turns prickly. There’s promise here, but delivery’s delayed. Price is per 375 ml.",28.0,79,40.0,3.0
3906,Dave Broom,"Bottled as one of last year’s Diageo Special Releases, this is very minty to start: mint chocolate to be precise, before Brazil nut and toasted bran appear, given balance by creamy oak.

3907,Dave Broom,"Craigellachie is one of Scotland’s most interesting distilleries: its worm tubs providing a deliberately sulfury new make whose aromas flash off after maturation to reveal a deeply floral, pineapple-accented palate. Here, sadly, an inactive cask has meant that cabbagey sulfur has not been fully worked out. The fleshiness of the mature spirit is emerging, but this should have been kept in cask for another five years or so. Lacks balance and maturity. £60",100.0,79,52.7,1.0
3910,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Very sweet butterscotch, sultanas, and smatterings of oak play off lime juice, sweet and sour sauce, and pulling citrus pith in a spirity but quintessentially smooth whisky. Creamy caramel shows hints of fudge that softens the crispness of freshly split red cedar shakes. Simple and tightly integrated. A sintering peppery heat quickly dominates the palate even as overripe fruits emerge in a finish that moves single-mindedly into a classic citric zest. A frisky mixer that is well worth sipping.",10.0,79,40.0,4.0
3911,Lew Bryson,"Fiery young stuff! The nose is spicy/slicey, with a sharp sweetness, fresh oak, and a hint of solvent. A lot of oak in the mouth, almost drying, and just a bit astringent on the tongue. The finish turns softer, sweeter, but stays oaky. The wood’s a bit overwhelming on this one. It’s sourced whiskey that’s then finished in Long Island wine barrels. Some finishes work better than others.",40.0,79,45.0,3.0
3912,Davin de Kergommeaux,"It’s not whisky in Canada, nor does it pretend to be. Canada’s three-year aging law keeps un-aged whisky off the market. So, with no moonshine or firewater tradition, Canada’s craft distillers must make their white spirits as palatable as the matured whiskies they could eventually become. The result is simple, gingery, and sweet, with latent peppermint, licorice, and beer. The palate dissolves in a longish finish where sizzling pepper grows refreshingly bitter before fading to… nothingness. (Ontario only) C$37",37.0,79,40.0,4.0

expressions. The lineup also boasts striking new packaging and is bottled non-chill filtered. Orange fondant cream and peaches on the nose, with caramel in the background. Fuller-bodied than the 15 year old expression, with pineapple cheesecake and ginger on the palate.

Very hot, as expected, but the smoke is more pronounced, with a creamy texture. Water brings out more malt, and notes of cocoa, ripe Red Delicious apple, and nuts…and a somewhat rough finish. Interesting, and mixable.",24.0,79,62.0,3.0
3917,Lew Bryson,"There’s the sweet reek of new make: barely ripe apricot and peach, green grain, a hint of spice. The spirit is surprisingly dry, with shots of grain, pepper, and some clean alcohol notes on the top, but a well-mannered 100 proof indeed, and easy to hold on the tongue. There’s a dry twist of anise on the finish. An interesting — and promising — white whiskey. (Pennsylvania only.)",30.0,79,50.0,3.0
3918,Lew Bryson,"Slightly medicinal/mineral edge to a nose full of caramel. Hot in the mouth, slick and sweet, but with some currant and quince floating around; there’s more than a bit of youthful whiteness here. The finish stays hot and prickles the tongue a bit. A bold Canadian, with some flaws, but interesting nonetheless.",27.0,79,40.0,4.0
3919,Dave Broom,"This is coming from a first fill sherry hogshead, so there’s little surprise that the color is as dark as pitch. This is Glenfarclas at its most concentrated; less about dried fruit and more about highly-roasted espresso with a glass of ancient Marsala on the side. The palate shows firm grip moving into astringency. Too much cask for me, but if this is what rocks your boat, go for it! £840",1318.0,79,47.0,1.0
3920,Dave Broom,"London-based specialist The Whisky Exchange won’t reveal where its main Islay brand is distilled, though the smart money is on a distillery not that far away from the ferry terminal that gives it its name. This expression is less phenolic than you might expect; there’s more rapeseed oil than smoke, but it does have a nori wrap shoreline character. The palate is discreet, with pineapple and creaminess leading the way toward a bonfire made of old fishboxes. £60",96.0,79,58.6,
3925,Dave Broom,"Shy is the word. Pale in color, again suggestive of little cask interaction. There’s a little hint of white currant and light cereal, delicate and fragile — more fragile than the Balmenach — with a little touch of white chocolate. As it opens, out comes violet. The mouth is tense, as if everything is still baled up, even after all this time. Very light acidity gives a certain freshness that water doesn’t shake loose. Simply not enough cask. £67",105.0,79,54.4,1.0
3929,Dave Broom,"A quintet of releases showing examples of The Glenlivet from five decades, issued to support The Glenlivet Generations 70 year old bottling. All are available individually or in a limited edition set (50 only) for £2,850; these bottlings are not currently available in the U.S. The nose immediately betrays the fact that this has been matured in a first-fill sherry hogshead. It’s akin to an artisan’s workshop, all leather oil and strange resins. There’s an intriguing hint of curry spices and truffle, but all in all this is about density, black fruits (damson), allspice, and clove. The cask is in charge. The palate has more tannin than you perhaps want — powerful and grippy with lots of nut and tea-like tannins; too grippy for me. £500",820.0,79,50.1,1.0
3931,Dave Broom,"Somewhat sidelined thanks to the presence of Glenrothes and Glen Grant (not to mention Speyburn) in the same village, Glen Spey gets on with producing fillings for numerous Diageo blends (primarily J&B). As a result, it’s rarely seen as a single malt, with even independent bottlings pretty thin on the ground.
This 21 year old is the color of old gold, and while the nose initially surprises with a hint of suet dumplings, there’s a rich and dangerously hedonistic sweetness behind, which is strangely hard to pin down. Coconut cream? Suntan lotion? Blackening butter in a frying pan? Eventually it appears to settle in the crème brûlée area, along with a fruity base (sweet, of course). There’s a light green note that suggests it might be distillery character coming through, but water suggests it’s new wood. 
In the mouth, there’s vanilla fudge and toffee, before a hint of muesli alongside dried mango. Overall it’s a bit like eating breakfast in a new ski chalet. Showy and impressive, but for me the wood’s in charge.",185.0,79,50.4,1.0
3934,John Hansell,"Richer, sweeter (with more caramelized sugars), fruitier, and spicier than the standard Canadian Mist (reviewed below). Still, I wish it were a bit smoother (especially on the finish) for something I would consider drinking neat on a regular basis. There’s no age statement, but a couple more years of aging would be nice. Like the flagship Canadian Mist, this whisky still plays it fairly conservatively — not a lot of risk-taking here. But I think it’s slightly better than Crown Royal Black (its logical competitor) which is not as smooth on the finish, and you can get Black Diamond for half the price.",15.0,79,43.0,4.0
3935,John Hansell,"This whisky is not as good as the similarly-aged, more polished and refined, standard distillery-bottled 25 year old cask-strength expression (our ""Whisky of the Year"" several years ago). This single cask bottling from a sherry cask is intensely sherried. Sappy fruit notes dominate the palate. Damp, somewhat tired, oak notes are prevalent throughout. The whisky is also nutty, with heathery peat notes emerging occasionally. The floral, heather-honeyed grace treasured in Highland Park struggles to emerge, and ultimately loses the battle. (Bottled exclusively for Park Avenue Liquors.)",185.0,79,58.0,1.0
3936,John Hansell,"Plenty of citrus zest, along with subtle pineapple and coconut on the nose. The palate begins with honeyed-malt sweetness, followed by the citrus fruit, but then quickly turns dry and resinous, with dried nuts and spicy oak on the finish. The intensity of the dryness on the finish surprised me and detracted from an otherwise well-rounded dram.",125.0,79,43.0,1.0
3937,John Hansell,"Enjoyable creamy texture and medium-bodied. Gently sweet notes of light toffee and vanilla custard, especially towards the front of the palate. Nutty too, with some sultana in the background. Gentle oak notes towards the finish. A very clean, well-balanced whisky that’s very easy to drink but also takes few risks.",27.0,79,43.0,1.0
3938,John Hansell,"A peculiar Auchentoshan. The Bordeaux wine dominates, with its distinctive winery aroma and flavor. Red raspberry, red currant, and a hint of strawberry comprise the core of this whisky, with underlying notes of vanilla cream, cocoa, and a hint of demerara rum. The whisky spent nine of its years in Bordeaux wine casks. I would have preferred less time in the wine casks for such a delicate whisky.",120.0,79,51.0,1.0
3939,John Hansell,"This is pot still Woodford Reserve bourbon finished in Sonoma-Cutrer Chardonnay wine barrels. (It’s the second iteration in the Master’s Collection, following the Four Grain release.) The wine influence is immediately obvious-it is sweet and fruity on the nose and palate. Notes of caramel apples, toffee pudding, butterscotch, toasted pecan, and peach crisp. Polished oak finish. I’d like a little less sweetness-or a little more of something to balance it, like more dried oak spice.",90.0,79,43.2,2.0
3940,John Hansell,"Lushly fruity and quite sweet. A bit too sappy on the nose, but more even-keeled on the palate. The fruit notes (nectarine, plum, orange marmalade) sit on a bed of caramel, shortbread, and thick honey, with chocolate-covered almonds emerging on the finish. For those who like their Highland Park youthful and very sherried. (Bottled for Grape Vine Market)",80.0,79,56.3,1.0
3942,John Hansell,"A bourbon with a gentle demeanor and easy drinkability. The whisky is nicely balanced, with sweet notes of corn, caramel, and vanilla blending in nicely with subtle fruit and dried spice. An uncomplicated, fairly straight-forward bourbon for everyday drinking. I just wish there was more to it.",40.0,79,45.5,2.0
3944,John Hansell,"Quite palate-coating for a Lowlander, with sweet notes of vanilla malt, grist, honey and marshmallow. More subtle notes of cut grass, linseed oil, rubber erasers, and chalky antacid tablets. A peculiar-tasting whisky.",62.0,79,43.0,1.0
3945,John Hansell,"Rich and viscous in texture. Sappy waxed fruit, maple syrup, and nougat. Becoming quite nutty with emerging notes of damp peat, dates, plum and blueberry. The sherry is fairly dominant and masks some of the whisky's subtleties. After dinner with a cigar, perhaps? (Bottled exclusively for Beltramo's.)",120.0,79,53.8,1.0
3946,John Hansell,"Aged in bourbon oak and then finished in Guigal Hermitage Rouge Syrah wine casks. Bright notes of red raspberry, rhubarb, currant, plum, and (not surprisingly) grape, with background notes of vanilla and caramel. I find the syrah notes entertaining on the nose, but too dominant on the palate for balance. The fruit becomes waxy and hides a lot of Bruichladdich subtle complexities. (Bottled exclusively for The Party Source.)",80.0,79,50.0,1.0
3947,John Hansell,"Very pale. A little thin in body, sharp and penetrating. Very Caol Ila-like, with notes of damp peat, Greek olives, seaweed, mustard seed, incense, gin herbs, freshly ground pepper, and vanilla malt. Smoldering peat finish. I would like to see more body to this whisky. (634 bottles produced.)",55.0,79,46.0,1.0
3948,John Hansell,"Jura’s newest offering, and the oldest in the portfolio. It is drastically different than its younger siblings-this one is quite sherried, as its deep amber color with reddish hues suggests. I really enjoy how this whisky tastes on the palate-it’s rich and silky with notes of fruitcake, toffee, maple, orange chocolate truffle, cinnamon, and nutmeg. You’ll find the same notes on the nose, but there are also elements-cloying fruit, perfume, and a peculiar fleshy component-which detract from an otherwise lovely whisky.",130.0,79,43.0,1.0
3949,John Hansell,"Dominant notes of citrus (lemon, lime) and other tropical fruits (coconut, mango) on the nose. On the palate, the whisky is simple and uncomplicated. The entry is soft and malty, and then it becomes dry and gently oaky. Not overly inspiring, but those who purchase the whisky for its rarity value (the distillery closed in 1983), shouldn’t be discouraged from actually drinking the stuff some day.",150.0,79,43.0,1.0
3950,John Hansell,"Not immature, but very intense and unabashed. Sweet barley notes and vanilla are beaten up by coal tar, damp kiln smoke, and fiery spice on the finish. For those who like their Islay whiskies young. Very young. I would have waited a couple more years before bottling this one. Pure testosterone. (Bottled for Maxwell Street Trading Co.)",65.0,79,46.0,1.0
3953,John Hansell,"Matured in a refill sherry cask. (A first-fill sherry cask would have completely dominated Rosebank’s delicate flavor profile.) With the addition of water (which is necessary), the whisky becomes quite cloudy. Rosebank’s traditional honeyed vanilla, grass/hay, and soft fruit are accentuated by lightly sherried, soft toffee flavors. An interesting whisky, but the flavors are not clean and well-defined enough to warrant a higher rating.",100.0,79,59.3,1.0
3954,John Hansell,"There’s no age statement, but the whisky is less than 10 years old -- and is a little green. Notes of toffee almonds, ripe fruit, freshly-ground pepper, chorizo, bacon fat, and damp peat smoke. Lingering smoke and brine on the finish. A few more years of maturation should improve this whisky significantly.",33.0,79,42.0,1.0
3955,John Hansell,"A more significant oak impact when compared to the standard Old Forester bourbons, which is evident by the polished leather, tobacco, and dry resin notes (especially on the finish). There’s an attempt to balance all this wood with notes of dusty corn, coconut, mint, vanilla, juniper, and dark berried fruit (blueberry, black raspberry, black cherry), but I don’t think it quite gets there. This bourbon is a nice change of pace (and I understand the reason behind this whisky -- to emulate bourbons from the era of Repeal), but I prefer the Old Forester “Signature” 100 proof to this whiskey. I’m happy drinking the whiskeys of today, thank you. (Price is per 375 ml.)",25.0,79,50.0,2.0
3957,John Hansell,"Finished in sherry casks. The sherry adds a nutty toffee sweetness, bramble, and other assorted red fruit and raisin, with the tell-tale Glenmorangie complexity tucked underneath. A bit heavy on the sherry, though, for such a subtle spirit.",65.0,79,46.0,1.0
3960,Fred Minnick,"Non-chill filtered plus a lot of age equals oak meeting caramel, vanilla, earth, nuttiness, and mildew. Slight hints of anise, rose petals, tree bark, and overcooked rice, before over-oaked flavor dominates with medicinal notes and soap. Bitterness, earth, and a saving grace of herbs follow for a decent, albeit woody finish. This is simply over-oaked. I’d love to have tasted this bottled three to seven years ago.",250.0,78,50.0,2.0
3966,Gavin Smith,"This bottling from an unspecified Highland distillery is intended to represent the style of whisky to be produced in the Raasay distillery, currently under construction.  Peated to a level of 15ppm, this expression has been finished in Tuscan red wine casks.  4,000 bottles are available. Buttery farmyard aromas, with red berries and a sense of relative youth.  Silky on the palate, with intense fruit sweetness and an immediate delivery of very spicy peat. Pepper and peat in a medium-length finish. £55",80.0,78,46.0,
3969,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A version of the classic Canadian Hunter from Sazerac, this is a very enjoyable whisky for sipping on ice or with a simple mixer. A dry nose is a bit closed showing soft spirit, caramel, and hints of maple. The sweet, hot, and slightly pulling palate has a grapefruit juice sharpness that keeps it fresh. Maple syrup sweetens a hot, longish finish that has the feel of black licorice. Simple, fun whisky.",11.0,78,45.0,4.0
3970,Geoffrey Kleinman,"This young peated malt, aged at least 24 months, has a nice, dry peat smoke nose, backed by honey and oak. On the palate it’s disjointed: the young peat malt argues with the heavy char barrel, a struggle that needs more time to be worked out. Honeyed malt tries to lend support but everything topples in the mid-palate, where things turn dry, spicy, and slightly acidic. A medium finish wraps up a whiskey that simply needs more time.",70.0,78,46.0,3.0
3971,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Pale gold in color, this whiskey is noticeably cloudy, even in a warm room. Swift's nose is pleasant, with malt, honey, and butterscotch. The entry is exceptionally thin, with a hint of malt and honey, but there's not much to it. In the mid-palate, it’s all about the bourbon barrel, so much so that the overall character shifts toward corn whiskey. A short finish with chocolate notes wraps up a whiskey that just doesn’t have much to say.",55.0,78,43.0,3.0
3972,Davin de Kergommeaux,"A simple, straightforward session whisky. True North is rich in the classic caramel notes and searing pepper so coveted by shooters and tailgaters. Ginger and white pepper last seemingly forever. Given its undeniable drinkability, packaging in a plastic bottle is probably a good idea. You can sip this if you wish, but with ginger ale and a dash of bitters it becomes a Canadian Saturday night in a glass. A classic Canadian bottom-shelfer. (Canada only)",22.0,78,40.0,4.0
3974,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Big Bottom finishes their light-style Barlow Trail whiskey in 10 year old tawny port casks. On the nose it's promising, with oak, blackberry jam, orange, vanilla, and rye spice. The entry is soft and light with vanilla and berry, but it shifts dramatically in the mid-palate, which is exceptionally spicy and dry. Big Bottom’s previous port cask finishes have been blockbusters, but the light-style Barlow Trail whiskey doesn't have the same level of balance and integration to prevail.",38.0,78,45.5,3.0
3977,Lew Bryson,"Like the Whim Mocha Porter, this is certified organic; a wheat whiskey made with locally-grown hops. Hard to tease out hops vs. small barrel oak spice in the nose; it’s bold and shouty. Wow. The hops are explosive in the mouth, flashing bitter on the tongue. The first sip was shocking, now it’s settling in, and becoming smoother, but I just don’t think this much hops is a good idea in a whiskey. Price is per 375 ml.",34.0,78,46.0,3.0
3978,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Buttered popcorn combines with wet pavement, vanilla, and black pepper for an interesting but edgy nose. The entry is light and sweet with vanilla and buttered corn, and a silky smooth mouthfeel. The mid-palate thins things out a bit and shifts focus to strong black pepper. This black pepper drives a spicy and dry finish. Many white whiskies straddle the line between whisky and vodka, and this one edges a little too close to the vodka space.",33.0,78,40.0,3.0
3979,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Distilled at the start of 2009, this special edition was bottled mid-2014, making it a 5 ½ year old whisky. The nose is ashy paste with a good measure of barnyard funk along with sherry, oak, and clove spice. The entry is all ashtray, a late night of sweet wine and cigarettes. Sherry notes fight the smoke to emerge, but the smoke simply dominates. A smoky, ashy, spicy, and dry finish round out a face-slapper of a whisky. (U.S. only)",130.0,78,57.9,1.0
3981,Lew Bryson,"Caramel, brown sugar, vanilla, generic sweetness. Smooth entry, and more of the same on the tongue with some alcohol heat in the finish. Very little wood at all. Begging to be poured into Coke. Maybe most jarring is that the Hatfield & McCoy “brand” recalls the infamous feud that took place on the Kentucky-West Virginia border…while this was distilled in South Carolina. At least the label’s honest as far as that. Sourced whiskey.",39.0,78,40.0,3.0
3982,Lew Bryson,"Plainly states it’s “aged four months in a small oak barrel.” Tame nose; working hard to pull out anything other than alcohol heat, some fresh-cut wet wood, and wet cereal. Quite hot, with lots of wet oak sawdust and sweet cinnamon that rocket right into the finish. Reminds me of a young teenager, running around, shouting at inappropriate moments, and very excited. Too young and hot right now. Put it back in the barrel; maybe a larger one. Price is per 375 ml.",32.0,78,44.0,3.0
3985,Dave Broom,"Hailing from the Speyside distillery, this has a deep orange color and an aroma of damp hay and a slightly vegetal note alongside caramel and peanut brittle. A perception of bitterness beside dried peels. The palate is thick with stewing fruits, tinned prune, and burnt sugar, with a background note of wet draff. Water lifts things a little, but it's all rather sick and flabby. £150",250.0,78,46.0,1.0
3986,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Lots of green notes in the nose of this mason jar variety of moonshine, including green apple, green bean, and wheat grass. Strong brewer’s yeast and cornmeal round things out in a highly aromatic nose. For the proof, the entry is remarkably soft and sweet, tasting like buttered cornbread. Fire and spice aren’t far behind, with black pepper, white pepper, and charred Cracker Jack. Long, dry, and slightly hot finish with a hint of popcorn and green bean.",25.0,78,51.5,3.0
3988,Dave Broom,"Light onionskin color; the nose is scented with red fruits, cranberry sauce, hawthorn jelly, and red apple. With water there’s some bletted medlars mixed with lemon. Sadly, the palate is soapy to start with, before the super-ripe red fruits come through. Water makes things fresher, but overall it lacks personality.",119.0,78,46.0,1.0
3989,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The heritage grains movement influenced distiller Jesse Razaqpur at Toronto distillery to make whisky from an old-time Ontario variety called Red Fife. This hard red wheat contains less starch than the traditional soft wheat used for whisky making, yielding less spirit. Red Fife wheat also contains flavor-inducing anthocyanins, similar to red-grape flavenoids. Distinctive grain dust and slate-like mineral notes dominate the nose, translating into searing hot pepper, ripe red fruit, and a slight sourness on the palate.

3991,Davin de Kergommeaux,"While their home-distilled whisky matures, some dedicated craft whisky makers hone their blending skills using sourced whiskies to create blends such as this one. Caramel heated to the point of burning, and oily, freshly-roasted coffee with hints of real maple syrup gloriously overtake a spirity nose that betrays the youth of this simple, no age statement work in progress. Scrumptious elements of clean oak, burned lumber, sawdust, and earthy pineyness are beguiling, but would benefit from tighter balance. (Saskatchewan only.) C$33",33.0,78,40.0,4.0
3992,Gavin Smith,"Inchmurrin is one of many single malts produced by Loch Lomond. It is made using lightly peated malt and matured in bourbon casks, and is named after one of the islands in Loch Lomond. Caramac chocolate and peanut butter on the sweet, fruity nose. The fruit motif continues on to the palate, where spicy malt, vanilla, and ripe peaches predominate. The finish is medium in length and nutty. £50",77.0,78,46.0,1.0
3993,Lew Bryson,"Small barrel whiskey, 100% corn. Rich, sweet, oaky nose with—at first—notes of peppermint and Rice Krispies treats; nose collapses and becomes sharp, woody, burnt. Fiery mouth, smoky notes, dry wood, and hot mint are overwhelming and somewhat astringent. Finish lingers much longer than would be pleasant; hot and tingly, with a redeeming core of corn. Tastes like it was pushed, hard, to be done.",60.0,78,46.0,3.0
3994,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Prior to Prohibition, Golden Wedding was a fine American whiskey. Decades later, entrepreneur Louis Rosenstiel successfully revived the brand in Canada. The result shows hints of burnt toffee, dusty rye, dry grain, and pickle juice. Earthy elements underscore river plants and citrus pith. Hot, peppery spices bolster lively spirits while jammy fruit and floral overtones round out a straight-on mixer. A whisky that transforms ginger ale into ginger ale.

3996,Lew Bryson,"Does this belong here, at 70% cane sugar and 30% corn/wheat? The process sure looks like whiskey, so we’ll let it slip in. The aroma’s sweet, but with a solvent rim to it. For 105 proof, this is pretty smooth stuff in the mouth. There are notes of melon and green corn, and a wet hint of fresh grass before the burner kicks on at the finish. It’s a hot end on this one, but not unpleasant.",35.0,78,52.5,3.0
3997,Lew Bryson,"New make fruit—pear, stewed apple—and rye spice in a hot, clean nose. That’s pretty much what you get in the mouth, too, with some dry paper notes, and a sweet finish.

3999,Dave Broom,"Touches of acetone and magic marker/solvent suggest that there’s precious little cask involvement going on here. Pleasing enough, with lime jelly and kiwi fruits, and a little whiff of sweet oak, but it’s very understated. In the mouth, it performs in a nutty way but doesn’t seem to have moved much over its quarter of a century sequestration. There is some horchata and brazil nut, even a mashy note, but it either needs more time or a kick to get it moving. £70",110.0,78,55.6,1.0
4000,John Hansell,"Aged “over 2 years” and with over 38% rye in the mashbill (high for bourbon). It’s fresh, youthful, and brisk, with sweet corn, bright fruit, brittle mint, cinnamon, and a dusting of cocoa, leading to a slightly aggressive finish.

4003,John Hansell,"Not exactly black. (More like russet, but Crown Royal Russet isn’t as catchy.) It’s nice to see the higher strength, and there’s definitely more flavor here than the standard Crown Royal or Crown Royal Reserve. But it’s missing the smoothness and elegance I cherish in other Crown Royal whiskies. Notes of molasses and maple syrup, accentuated by burnt fig, hints of pedro ximenez sherry, and raisin. There are suggestions of dark rum and bourbon in here. (Perhaps an alternative to both?) A whisky to drink on the rocks or as a mixer.",30.0,78,45.0,
4004,John Hansell,"A sherry cask-matured Bowmore. Introduced as ""the brother"" to the 1989 vintage Bowmore released about a year ago (aged in bourbon casks). Notes of waxed fruit, dates, fruitcake, and raisin permeate through tarry rope, leather boots, wet socks, and ripe peat.

   Style: Highland (Isle of Arran) single malt Scotch whisky. Price: high $30s. Available nationwide. 
   Again there is no age statement, and this one is still on the youthful side, but it is richer (some sherry cask aging in the mix?) and expresses more flavors-and deeper flavors-than the one mentioned above.

4007,John Hansell,"Barton’s entry into the premium, small batch bourbon category is a heavy hitter indeed. There are flavors of toffee, leather, and resinous spices throughout, with some background notes of fruit (especially figs and dates) and a dusting of cocoa. This is a full, richly textured bourbon. Its aroma is lovely and everything is working well on the palate, too-until about mid-palate, where it becomes very woody, assertive, out of balance, and quite dry all the way through its finish, to the point of becoming excessive. Otherwise, this would be a great whiskey.",23.0,78,46.85,2.0
4008,John Hansell,"Antique amber. Deeper, brooding, and less sweet than the 14 year old bottling. Distinct notes of leather, roasted nuts, and hints of tobacco on the nose and palate, along with some of the flavors of its younger sibling. It works on the nose, but the tannins (both from the wine and oak) impart a leather component that just dominates the palate.

Cloying, waxy finish.",110.0,78,55.6,1.0
4010,John Hansell,"Obviously aged in a sherry cask. Juicy fruit, syrupy, a bit waxy, notes of maple syrup and spice (clove, mint).

4014,Jeffery Lindenmuth,"There is a certain rusticity here, with a nose rooted in rhum agricole, sweet malt, honeycomb, butterscotch, and molasses, tinged with furniture polish and varnish notes.

4017,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Porridge, butterscotch, and a little dust on the nose. Rosewater and some spice on the palate, but the floral notes are out of balance. Hot peppers, slightly pulling, and a bit mealy on the tongue, then a pleasing earthiness. The label says “ultra premium,” the taste says “not so much.” The best feature is the pepper, which will bolster ginger ale and cut through cola because this is not really for sipping.",20.0,77,40.0,4.0
4019,Lew Bryson,"Palmetto distillery has been making ‘moonshine’ products so far, and now they have some spirit aged in new French oak. Aromas of sweet pastry dough, new rubber, horehound, and bitter orange make for an intriguing nose. The mouth is fiery hot, thin in body, and tends to stay that way through to the end. The horehound blends with rye bitterness to make this a bit medicinal. Hot for sipping, but should make a very good Old Fashioned.",30.0,77,44.65,3.0
4020,Lew Bryson,"Screaming oak nose for a relatively young whiskey; about all that’s there is whiskey-soaked staves and some hot spice. Drillingly-hot entry; I’ve tasted bourbons at 60% that were less hot. Roaring oak fire with some underlying corn sweetness; this isn’t subtle or quiet on the tongue. Water brings out more—sweet corn, mint, rye oil—but the oak still dominates. Almost astringent in the finish. If you like big oak, here it is, but forget balance.",50.0,77,50.0,2.0
4023,Lew Bryson,"“Smoked” with a maceration of Lapsang Souchong tea (which leaves some fine sediment). Thickly sweet and herbal nose in a ruddy whiskey; like a sweetened, aged genever. On the palate, this 70% 7 year old MGP corn, 30% unaged Two James rye is woody and ash-bitter in the core, with a wrapping of that sweetness. The herbal character saves it from the squabble between sweet and bitter, but it comes off more as a tonic than a whiskey.",49.0,77,43.5,3.0
4024,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Aged one day in new American oak, this white dog ekes out the very minimum requirements for bourbon. The nose is heavy barnyard, complete with hay, horse, and manure. Beyond the funk is cornmeal, cashew, and apple blossom. The palate is light and what you'd expect, with yeasty cornbread, sour apple, apple blossom, and black pepper. The funk is still there but not as intense as on the nose. Interesting overall character with aging potential, but for now it’s unbaked.",30.0,77,40.0,3.0
4029,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Although this moonshine may look down-home in a mason jar, it was produced using the highly technical TerrePure process, designed to remove most congeners. The result is a corn neutral spirit that doesn’t smell or taste much like corn. Instead, it’s soft vanilla, toasted marshmallow, and a dash of salt. A little heat and white pepper round things out for a long, peppery-dry finish. It’s pretty good for a vodka, but is it really moonshine or white whiskey? Probably not.",15.0,77,40.0,3.0
4030,Lew Bryson,"From TerrePure; there’s that reassuring note on the label that the whiskey is “Aged at least six months.” Nose is somewhat flat, compressed; diner mints, old cinnamon sticks, cattle feed.

Uninspiring, if surprisingly smooth for 6 month old whiskey.",12.0,77,45.0,3.0

4032,Lew Bryson,"Extremely dark color; aged in ten-gallon barrels. A thick burbling nose, full of dark aromas: smoke, molasses, earth, and moist tobacco, with a sharp woody twist around the outside. The mouth recapitulates much of that, but in a brighter fashion…and then the small barrel takes over; tight, intense wood that blows out everything else and leaves the tongue tingling.

4037,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Rum—“screech,” as it is called where it is made—is Newfoundland’s spirit of choice. With three shots of screech and a ceremony involving fish, visitors are transformed into honorary Newfies. This 3 year old Amherst whisky, custom blended for the Newfoundland Liquor Commission, is ancient by comparison. It’s a basic mixer that arrives peppery hot with strong overtones of half-tamed spirit. Dusty wood, lime peels, and burnt toffee foretell a leisurely slide into refreshing bitterness. Definitely not screech. (Newfoundland only)  C$25",25.0,77,40.0,4.0
4039,Davin de Kergommeaux,"The discontinued 10 year old CC Reserve was typical of the hard-rye genre, with vanilla, caramel, ripe fruit, and hot pepper stitched onto a flinty-firm base. This new 9 year old version, though similar, has obvious differences. Pleasing heat rides an initial surge of toffee, dry grain, and dried dark fruit. A soon-to-arrive pithiness on the shortish finish refreshes, but without the familiar steeliness of its antecedent.",17.0,77,40.0,4.0
4040,Lew Bryson,"Berkshire Mountain Distillers uses locally grown corn here, aged on local oak and cherry wood. The nose is sweet and sharp, smelling of corn, grass, and tart cherries. Corn and ash dominate the hot, slippery mouth, with a finish that turns sweeter as it dwindles, with some faint fruit notes, but the heat is hard to overcome. If it were my corn, I’d put it into the bourbon instead; this is a bit thin.",40.0,77,43.0,3.0
4041,Lew Bryson,"There’s a somewhat oily, faint green look to this in the bottle. Strong aroma of corn, some green apple, and a faint hint of smoke and wet dog.

4042,Dave Broom,"The second of the duo — destined for the U.S. and Taiwan — is a relative youngster and has been extracted from a fresh Spanish oak sherry hogshead. The combination of first-fill and smaller cask size is immediately apparent. The color is mocha dark and the nose has a distinctly sulfurous twist, behind which are black cherries dipped in chocolate, tonka bean, and leather. For me, there’s too much cask and not sufficient Rothes complexities, especially on the palate.",375.0,77,57.0,1.0
4048,Lew Bryson,"Hot solvents on the nose, reminiscent of Hinkle’s Easter egg dyes. Heavy-handed sweet wash of caramel, very hot, cloying finish. Not easy to see this as related to the clean innocence of the standard expression.",20.0,77,,4.0
4049,Dave Broom,"The lightness of the hue suggests a very slow maturation in refill casks, and while I tried hard to get to grips with this, I found the nose simply too discreet. There’s a hint of the burning bonfire which indicates the subtle smoke that underpins Cragganmore; there’s even some parma violet, dried berries, and a hint of sulfur.
The palate picks things up a little, showing ferns, wet moss, Oolong tea, and dried apple, as well as citrus and — surprisingly — some just-lit cigar fuminess. It’s all rather understated, however. This is one of my top distilleries, but compared to the recent Special Releases and magnificent Friends of the Classic Malts bottlings, this is slightly underwhelming.",205.0,77,56.0,1.0
4053,John Hansell,"Nice to see Arran making it to 12 years old. Creamy on the palate and soothing in nature, with layers of sweetness (maple and butterscotch syrup, vanilla cream) and fruit (caramel apple, fried banana). Soft, congenial finish. A low-level yet persistent nutty/burnt rubber note detracts from what would otherwise be a very fun, pleasantly sweet whisky. (Note: at the time of publication, the whisky was not yet available in the U.S. Price above is UK price, converted to dollars).",50.0,77,46.0,1.0
4054,John Hansell,"A very peculiar whisky. It’s interesting in some respects, with the thick, sweet Hungarian dessert wine fighting with damp peat smoke for attention. But it tastes a little disjointed, and a bit too youthful. With a few more years aging (before finishing in the Tokaji wine), the flavors should integrate and mature better. But as it is, this whisky is still “work in progress.”",50.0,77,45.0,1.0
4055,John Hansell,"This whisky comes from two bourbon casks, producing only 112 bottles. I believe it’s the most expensive Lowland whisky on the market. Unfortunately, its flavor doesn’t stand up to its price. While I applaud Morrison Bowmore's efforts to give us the opportunity to try such a mature expression of Auchentoshan, I feel that the whisky is past its prime. I wouldn't describe it as overly woody, like I have other whiskies that are 41 years old. Rather, I would describe it as overly funky. The whisky's aroma and flavor are very peculiar, with plenty of vegetal notes (cucumbers especially) combined with stewed fruit, golden raisins, rose petals, and spice (anise, clove). If it were $100 a bottle, I would suggest that you gather a few friends to chip in and buy a bottle, just for the experience. But at $2,000, I think we should leave this one for the collectors.",,77,40.3,1.0
4056,John Hansell,"The owners of Bunnahabhain are making a peated version of this normally unpeated Islay whisky to put in their peated blend, Black Bottle. But they have not yet put out, as a regular item, a peated expression of Bunnahabhain for purchase. However, some of the independent bottlers got their hands on some, and this might be the first one to be offered in the U.S. It’s what you would expect a 9 year old peated Bunnahabhain to taste like: toffee, vanilla fudge, and nuts (the Bunny signature), kiln peat smoke, and a bit too much youthfulness. It needs a few more years to mature to acceptable levels. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot.)",45.0,77,59.9,1.0

Spices persist through a slightly citric, cerealy, medium-length finish.",40.0,76,40.0,1.0
4066,Geoffrey Kleinman,"Wood tannins are an interesting thing; used correctly, they can help create spice, depth, and complexity, as well as define a spirit's character. Unrestrained, tannins can wreak havoc. That’s what’s happened with this whiskey. Sharp, unfinished wood defines a nose that is raw in every sense. A thin entry struggles to present maple and caramel before a heavy blast of oak tannins decimates them. Those tannins define the rest of the taste experience, including a sour and bitter finish.",35.0,76,45.0,3.0
4068,Lew Bryson,"Light amber color; no age statement, not labeled as “straight whiskey.” Nose of spiced hard candies, wet oak, mint. Very hot mouth, thin body, muddled flavors of candy and wood.

4073,Dave Broom,"Since Diageo has included Knockando in its Special Release program it seemed only right to reacquaint myself with the standard bottling. This is Speyside in its maltiest guise. The nose is reminiscent of breakfast cereal: Weetabix and bran flakes, with a whisper of vanilla.

4081,Lew Bryson,"Made from 100% rye, but aged in wine casks. Distinctly pink tinge: rosé whiskey. Very young nose: rye grain, Starburst candies, and feinty vegetable notes along with the wine-oak. Thin, dry, reminiscent of a dry hay barn: dusty grain, warm wood planks, a bit medicinal. Aged 130 days, and tastes like it. Growing up in Pennsylvania, Highspire was a town we stayed out of. Good advice.",50.0,75,40.0,3.0

The Ellington Whisky Company calls Princeton (Minneapolis) home. Here, it bottles whiskies imported from Canada. Where from, exactly? A trade secret. Caramel, prune juice, ripe yellow fruits, and hints of cooked, buttery corn mute a dry, spirity nose. Peppery and spicy, it blends caramel, bitter lemon soda, sweet ginger, and orange Fanta.

4093,John Hansell,"A new “upgrade” from the standard Old Crow, which is only three years old. Soft aroma of sweet corn, candy corn, vanilla, and light caramel, all following through on the palate. It finishes sweet (too sweet, actually), a bit grainy, and slightly hot. If this brand is meant to compete with Evan Williams, then this four year old should be the standard “Old Crow” and the Reserve expression should be more like five or six years old, because the standard Evan Williams bottling (with no age statement) is clearly superior to Old Crow Reserve.

The 10 and 12 year olds express less flavor complexity and are somewhat harsh on the finish. They’re not good enough to drink neat or on the rocks and too expensive to drink as a mixer ($38 for the 10 year old; $44 for the 12 year old.).

But mid-palate the age gets the best of this whisky. The flavors flatten out and the wood dominates through the finish as the leather notes linger. It’s a rare treat to taste a whisky this old. If you like Lalique (and have the money), then this new bottling is worth some consideration, because there are certainly moments of intrigue and pleasure on the nose and beginning of the palate. But I have tasted several other 50-plus year old Macallans, and I can say with certainty that the 50 year old Millennium bottling and the 1946 vintage release were better and can probably still be found for a significantly lower price (Only 420 bottles available worldwide.)",,74,40.1,1.0

Certainly an entertaining whisky, but a few more years in the barrel would round this whisky out, meld the flavors together, and add depth.",60.0,72,45.0,1.0
4133,John Hansell,"Youthful, and somewhat brooding for a Tomintoul. I can tell there’s some young whisky in here, as there’s a suggestion of new make spirit interwoven with notes of heather, ripe barley, raw peat, and lingering smoke. I like the concept, but wish the young component (the peated part of this whisky?) was matured a bit longer.",45.0,72,40.0,1.0
4136,Geoffrey Kleinman,"The nose starts with sweet corn, cornmeal, yeasty bread, and black pepper, with wet dog and a slight varnishy note right behind. The entry is soft and round, with dry cornmeal, bran flakes, and yeasty bread. Unfortunately, the varnish note from the nose returns pretty clearly in the mid-palate along with black pepper. Everything wraps up with a shorter than expected finish. The heart of this whiskey is interesting, but it could benefit from a much tighter cut. (distillery store only)",30.0,71,50.0,3.0
4138,John Hansell,"A big bourbon in many respects, but this is one whiskey where I would have happily settled for a “Single Barreled.” I tasted this whiskey straight from the barrel right before it was bottled and it was more aggressive; I think the lower strength and chill-filtering has helped to tame this beast. To be honest, there are some good qualities to this whiskey. The nose is wonderful! Even the palate starts out fine, with chewy toffee, molasses, dark fruit, raisins, and dates. But it is quickly consumed by intensely dry oak spice, gripping resin, and leather, which clings to my tongue and won’t let go. In this instance, last impressions are lasting impressions. Price is per 375 ml.",47.0,71,45.0,2.0
4139,John Hansell,"Aged in a sherry cask, which adds sweet notes of toffee, Caribbean rum, waxed fruit, red licorice, and fruitcake to go along with the earthy smoke and lingering peat. A much sweeter, fruitier affair than the Croftengea also reviewed here, but behind all that sherry there’s still a whisky that needs a little more maturing.",60.0,71,45.0,1.0
4140,Davin de Kergommeaux,"Traces of burnt caramel add interest to an otherwise simple, overly sweet palate. A triumvirate of alcohol, chocolate toffee, and pepper. A slight bitterness is more distracting than pleasing or refreshing. Reminiscent of Aunt Jemima pancake syrup, Sailboat is just too sweet to sip solo, but adding ginger ale increases the complexity, as spirit and sweetness mingle with ginger and carbonation. It would benefit from a bit more wood. A very inexpensive whisky, though not a bargain. $20 CAD",15.0,70,40.0,4.0
4143,Lew Bryson,"Clear, slight golden hue; as expected from a 7% straight whiskey/93% grain neutral spirit “spirit whiskey.” Faint nose of sweet caramel corn in a hot bloom of estery alcohol. Thickly sweet in the mouth, with barely a hint of whiskey, like a badly-made cocktail or an ill-conceived flavored vodka. While there are no glaring flaws in the make, this is simply a bad idea. Light whiskey failed once, in the 1970s, and for good reasons. Those reasons haven't changed.",30.0,70,40.0,3.0
4144,Lew Bryson,"It does say “whisky” on the label...followed by “with natural cinnamon flavor.” It's clear from the first sniff that this is a one-trick pony: hot, fiery cinnamon. But is there whisky flavor in there? Fireball's as sweet as the liqueur proof would indicate, and as hot as advertised, and there's only a hint of whisky character under the fire. A novelty for tailgating; probably great in hot chocolate.",16.0,70,33.0,4.0
4145,John Hansell,"The sherry is very dominant and cloying, which is unfortunate. And I’m not crazy about the quality of the sherry (or perhaps even the wood it was aged in). I have great respect for both Highland Park and Binny’s, but this is somewhat disappointing for a Highland Park. Tasted twice, with the same opinion. (Bottled for Binny’s Beverage Depot)",225.0,70,55.0,1.0
4146,John Hansell,"Earthy, fleshy notes with brooding grape notes and a gamey finish -- the Nebbiolo grape influence is obvious. I enjoy Barolo wine and I enjoy Edradour whisky, but the flavors in this whisky mix like oil and water. (Exclusive to Binny’s Beverage Depot.)",80.0,70,57.1,1.0
4153,Davin de Kergommeaux,"With its overt floral perfume notes and the scent of children’s powdered candy, this whisky is difficult to enjoy. Its unctuous artificial flavors are equally unsuitable for cocktails, mixing, or sipping. Fruity, winey, lavender notes duke it out with baby cereal and artificial coconut. The saving graces? A late lovely bitterness, long gingery burn, and creamy body. But then jujubes, grape gum and artificial bananas kick in and it’s over.",17.0,65,44.9,4.0
4154,Geoffrey Kleinman,"An unaged whiskey from Carroll County, Iowa, with rye grain and sugar mash. The nose is all kinds of barnyard funk: hay, horse, and manure. Underneath is a bite of sugar and vanilla. On the palate it’s less funky, with sugar, strawberry, and a grappa-like note. The rye spice emerges mid-palate, but it’s fleeting and leads to an edgy and fractured finish. Time in oak might help, but there are issues here that wood won’t resolve.",35.0,65,40.0,3.0
4155,John Hansell,"Fiery peat kiln smoke, tar, and ripe barley on the nose. Not overly complex, but not a problem either. On the palate, the whisky starts out acceptable enough. But by mid-palate, the whisky turns harsh and unpleasant, with petroleum and vegetal notes that continues through to the finish. (Exclusive to Astor Wines and Spirits.)",60.0,63,45.0,1.0
4157,Fred Minnick,"Although it’s not on the label, Cavalry uses the TerrePURE technology on 4 month old MGP whiskey. Its short time in wood shows. No traditional notes of bourbon sweetness, not even an earthy hint of wood found in many younger bourbons. This is more reminiscent of a neutral grain spirit than bourbon, but masked in the alcohol-centric flavor is a slight sweetness likely representing oak and a hint of grain. Sourced whiskey.",30.0,60,45.0,2.0
