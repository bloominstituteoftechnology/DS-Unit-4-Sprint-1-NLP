If you have the curiosity, passion, and collaborative spirit, work with us, and let\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s move the world forward, together.\\\\nAbout the Role\\\\n\\\\nBe at the center of Uber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s business in Marketplace, where riders and drivers come together at an extraordinary scale. Marketplace Data Scientists combine clear product vision, deep technical skills and powerful data analysis to improve the algorithms that run Uber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s vast worldwide marketplace every minute of the day. Come produce elegant solutions that are practical, effective, and can work at Uber scale.\\\\n\\\\nMarketplace Data Scientists tackle problems such as optimizing Uber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s short and long term pricing systems; efficiently matching incoming trip requests in Uber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s dispatch system; developing innovative incentive schemes that reward riders and drivers for choosing our network; and providing optimal routes and accurate turn-by-turn navigation to save time for everybody. The team also forecasts, monitors, and evaluates all aspects of Uber\\'s marketplace using both large scale observational data and thoughtful experimentation.\\\\nWhat You\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99ll Need\\\\n\\\\nMasters or PhD with an (anticipated graduation in 2019) in areas of focus within empirical modeling (Machine Learning and Statistics), marketplace efficiency (Economics, Operations Research & Operations Management), utilization of rich geospatial data to better understand mobility (Transportation Engineering), or Computer Science students who have a strong interest in these problem spaces\\\\nExperience in modeling and algorithm development\\\\nCoding proficiency and the ability to develop statistical analysis and prototype algorithms in Python or R\\\\nProficiency in SQL\\\\nAbility to communicate effectively with both technical and business stakeholders\\\\nAbout the Teams\\\\n\\\\nMarketplace Control | Take a holistic view of Uber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s two-sided marketplace to understand how different product levers (e.g. rider and driver pricing, promotions, matching) affect its efficiency, growth, and ability to generate value. Evaluate the balance of supply and demand across time and geography, investigate how Uber\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99s products shape riders\\\\xe2\\\\x80\\\\x99 expectations and behavior over time, assess how drivers respond to variation in their earnings, and examine how potential regulation changes could impact the health of the marketplace. Leverage techniques from a variety of disciplines, including operations research, statistics and economics, to address these open-ended questions.\\\\nDriver Pricing | Develop advanced and real-time pricing algorithms and driver tools that shape how drivers plan, move, and earn. Use elements of modeling, causal inference, forecasting, and optimization to design prices that dynamically align driver\\'s interests with those of riders and Uber\\'s business.\\\\nMarketplace Forecasting | Stand upstream of the marketplace optimization flow and generate time series and machine learning models for quantities like trips, demand, and supply. Empower downstream optimization decisions such as pricing and incentive allocation with these forecasts of varying levels of spatial/temporal granularity and different forecast horizons. Capture calendar patterns and shocks (holidays, events, and weather) using a combination of classical time series and statistical and machine learning approaches in a scalable way.\\\\nMarketplace Investments | Manage the macroeconomics of our rides marketplace. Every year, Uber spends billions of dollars to influence our marketplace toward healthy growth by deploying a variety of incentives and pricing levers. Develop the algorithms that decide how to invest across all our levers, across all our markets, and what it means to operationalize for healthy, more profitable growth. Interact with many other teams and gain a working knowledge of the many aspects of the massive dynamic system that is our Marketplace.\\\\nMarketplace Matching | Work on the backend algorithms that govern how riders and drivers are matched together across Uber\\'s network, from assigning a car for an UberX dispatch to deciding when to have two riders share a ride together in UberPOOL. Blend optimization, machine learning and algorithmic techniques to deliver efficient, scalable solutions for Uber\\'s network.\\\\nRider Engagement | Design rider incentive programs that grow, retain and engage our riders. We create production machine learning models, analyze network level experiments and use mechanism design principles to design incentives, measuring heterogeneous treatment effects, long term effects and marketplace effects. Run real-time causal machine learning models for promotion targeting, and help design the new subscription or loyalty program.\\\\nRider Pricing / Rider Fares | Develop the algorithms that set rider prices globally to optimize short and long run network efficiency and reliability. Build, deploy, and analyze large-scale real-time algorithms, from machine learning models predicting travel times and demand patterns, to the optimization models responsible for dynamic pricing.\"\"\",2019 University Graduate - Data Scientist - Marketplace\\n',\n",

    " - Use a clustering algorithm to cluster documents by their most important terms. Do the clusters reveal any common themes?\n",
    "  - **Hint:** K-means might not be the best algorithm for this. Do a little bit of research to see what might be good for this. Also, remember that algorithms that depend on Euclidean distance break down with high dimensional data."
