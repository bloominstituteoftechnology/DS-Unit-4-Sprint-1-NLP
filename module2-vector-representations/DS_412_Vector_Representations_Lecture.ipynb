We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n","\n","Processing text data to prepare it for machine learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a DataFrame and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n","\n","On the python side, we will be focusing on `sklearn` and `spacy` today.  \n","\n","## Case Study\n","\n","We're going to pretend we're on the datascience team at the BBC.

This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n","\n","### Embedding approaches preserve more textual context\n","Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n","\n","##3.1 Word2Vec Intuition\n","### The Distribution Hypothesis\n","\n","In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the [Distribution Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics). The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings. Practically speaking, this means that if two words are found to have similar words both to the right and to the left of them throughout the corpora then those words have the same context and are assumed to have the same meaning. \n","\n","> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" - John Firth\n","\n","This means that we let the usage of a word define its meaning and its \"similarity\" to other words. In the following example, which words would you say have a similar meaning? \n","\n","**Sentence 1**: Traffic was light today\n","\n","**Sentence 2**: Traffic was heavy yesterday\n","\n","**Sentence 3**: Prediction is that traffic will be smooth-flowing tomorrow since it is a national holiday\n","\n","What words in the above sentences seem to have a similar meaning if all you knew about them was the context in which they appeared above? \n","\n","Lets take a look at how this might work in action, the following example is simplified, but will give you an idea of the intuition for how this works.\n","\n","#### Corpora:\n","\n","1) \"It was the sunniest of days.\"\n","\n","2) \"It was the raniest of days.\"\n","\n","#### Vocabulary:\n","\n","{\"it\": 1, \"was\": 2, \"the\": 3, \"of\": 4, \"days\": 5, \"sunniest\": 6, \"raniest\": 7}\n","\n","### Vectorization\n","\n","|       doc   | START_was | it_the | was_sunniest | the_of | sunniest_days | of_it | days_was | it_the | was_raniest | raniest_days | of_END |\n","|----------|-----------|--------|--------------|--------|---------------|-------|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|--------|\n","| it       | 1         | 0      | 0            | 0      | 0             | 0     | 1        | 0      | 0           | 0            | 0      |\n","| was      | 0         | 1      | 0            | 0      | 0             | 0     | 0        | 1      | 0           | 0            | 0      |\n","| the      | 0         | 0      | 1            | 0      | 0             | 0     | 0        | 0      | 1           | 0            | 0      |\n","| sunniest | 0         | 0      | 0            | 1      | 0             | 0     | 0        | 0      | 0           | 0            | 0      |\n","| of       | 0         | 0      | 0            | 0      | 1             | 0     | 0        | 0      | 0           | 1            | 0      |\n","| days     | 0         | 0      | 0            | 0      | 0             | 0     | 0        | 0      | 0           | 0            | 1      |\n","| raniest  | 0         | 0      | 0            | 1      | 0             | 0     | 0        | 0      | 0           | 0            | 0      |\n","\n","Each column vector represents the word's context -in this case defined by the words to the left and right of the center word.

Word2Vec can consider a larger context than only words that are immediately to the left and right of a given word, but we're going to keep our window of context small for this example.

Hint: Look for values that are repeated in a given column. Each column represents the context that word was found in. If there are multiple words that share a context then those words are understood to have a closer meaning with each other than with other words in the text.\n","\n","Lets look specifically at the words sunniest and raniest. You'll notice that these two words have exactly the same 10-dimensional vector representation. Based on this very small corpora of text we would conclude that these two words have the same meaning because they share the same usage. Is this a good assumption? Well, they are both referring to the weather outside so that's better than nothing. You could imagine that as our corpora grows larger we will be exposed a greater number of contexts and the Distribution Hypothesis assumption will improve. \n","\n","##3.2 Word2Vec Variants\n","\n","###3.2.1 Skip-Gram\n","\n","The Skip-Gram method predicts the neighbors’ of a word given a center word. In the skip-gram model, we take a center word and a window of context (neighbors) words to train the model and then predict context words out to some window size for each center word.\n","\n","This notion of “context” or “neighboring” words is best described by considering a center word and a window of words around it. \n","\n","For example, if we consider the sentence **“The speedy Porsche drove past the elegant Rolls-Royce”** and a window size of 2, we’d have the following pairs for the skip-gram model:\n","\n","**Text:**\n","**The**\tspeedy\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (the, speedy), (the, Porsche)\n","\n","**Text:**\n","The\t**speedy**\tPorsche\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (speedy, the), (speedy, Porsche), (speedy, drove)\n","\n","**Text:**\n","The\tspeedy\t**Porsche**\tdrove\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (Porsche, the), (Porsche, speedy), (Porsche, drove), (Porsche, past)\n","\n","**Text:**\n","The\tspeedy\tPorsche\t**drove**\tpast\tthe\telegant\tRolls-Royce\n","\n","*Training Sample with window of 2*: (drove, speedy), (drove, Porsche), (drove, past), (drove, the)\n","\n","The **Skip-gram model** is going to output a probability distribution i.e. the probability of a word appearing in context given a center word and we are going to select the vector representation that maximizes the probability.\n","\n","With CountVectorizer and TF-IDF the best we could do for context was to look at common bi-grams and tri-grams (n-grams).

Can we visualize word vectors?\n","\n","300 dimensional word vectors are difficult (impossible) to visualize! <br>\n","However, we can use Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to reduce their dimensionality. <br>\n","\n","PCA is one of the most important techniques in machine learning, and indeed in all of mathematics! PCA transforms the feature vectors of a data set to their \"Principal Components\", which are ranked in order of their importance in describing the data set. By eliminating the less important Principal Components, we can reduce the dimensionality of the data set, at the cost of losing some information.\n","\n","If you're interested to explore this topic in greater depth, here are a couple of references:\n","- One of the best brief introductions to the mathematics of PCA is [Daniela Witten's tweetstorm](https://twitter.com/womeninstat/status/1285610321747611653?lang=en\n","- For a more in-depth, but still understandable exposition of PCA, watch the Statquest video [Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Step-by-Step](https://youtu.be/FgakZw6K1QQ) from Josh Starmer.\n","\n","Now let's use PCA to reduce our 300-dimensional word vectors down to two dimensions, so that we can visualize them in a plane. Of course, in the process we lose a lot of information, but these 2D word vectors still pack a surprising amount of information!"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"nbgrader":{"grade":false,"grade_id":"cell-c54d3921b438215d","locked":false,"schema_version":3,"solution":true,"task":false},"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"WNGfmJ13dRAV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1632867020669,"user_tz":420,"elapsed":157,"user":{"displayName":"Joseph catanzarite","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgmMRaw8NgoEDqzevEZ6b18iOYdEH9nWTZeaFBW=s64","userId":"16649206137414945374"}},"outputId":"07ace9e6-c28b-41c7-9197-70531e39c75a"},"source":["# import the PCA module from sklearn\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","\n","def get_word_vectors(words):\n","    # converts a list of words into their word vectors\n","    return [nlp(word).vector for word in words]\n","\n","words = ['machine learning', \n","         'artificial intelligence', \n","         'data', 'science', \n","         'concrete', 'wood', \n","         'marble', 'design',\n","         'color', 'font']\n","\n","\n","word_vectors = get_word_vectors(words)\n","\n","\n","# intialise pca model and tell it to project data down onto 2 dimensions\n","\n","# fit the pca model to our 300D data, this will work out which is the best \n","# way to project the data down that will best maintain the relative distances \n","# between data points.
