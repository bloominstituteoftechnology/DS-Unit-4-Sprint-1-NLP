If you think about it, our human brains have been exposed to quite a lot of training data to help us interpret languages, and even then we misunderstand each other pretty frequently. \n",

Stemming works well in applications where humans don't have to worry about reading the results. Search engines and more broadly information retrival algorithms use stemming. Why? Becuase it's fast. \n",

    "Lemmatization on the other hand is more methodical. The goal is to transform a word into's base form called a lemma. Plural nouns with funky spellings get transformed to singular tense. Verbs are all transformed to the transitive. Nice tidy data for a visualization. :) However, this tidy data can come at computational cost. Spacy does a pretty freaking good job of it though. Let's take a look:"
