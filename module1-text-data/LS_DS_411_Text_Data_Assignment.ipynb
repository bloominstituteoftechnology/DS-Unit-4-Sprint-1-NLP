    "Your goal in this assignment: find the attributes of the best & worst coffee shops in the dataset. The text is fairly raw: dates in the review, extra words in the `star_rating` column, etc. You'll probably want to clean that stuff up for a better analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Analyze the corpus of text using text visualizations of token frequency. Try cleaning the data as much as possible. Try the following techniques: \n",
    "- Lemmatization\n",
    "- Custom stopword removal\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind the attributes of good tokens. Once you have a solid baseline, layer in the star rating in your visualization(s). Key part of this assignment - produce a write-up of the attributes of the best and worst coffee shops. Based on your analysis, what makes the best the best and the worst the worst. Use graphs and numbesr from your analysis to support your conclusions. There should be plenty of markdown cells! :coffee:"
