The hard thing about NLP is that human languages are far less structured or consistent than computer languages.

How do you get a machine to understand sarcasm, irony, synonyms, connotation, denotation, nuance, and tone of voice? All without it having lived a lifetime of experience for context? If you think about it, our human brains have been exposed to a lot of training data to help us interpret languages, and even then, we misunderstand each other pretty frequently. \n",

You will need to 'activate' the conda environment: `source activate U4-S1-NLP` on Terminal or `conda activate U4-S1-NLP` on Anaconda Prompt. Once your environment is activated, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` which, will install the required packages into your environment.\n",
